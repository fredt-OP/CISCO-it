<text><![CDATA[<br>1. The StadiumCompany is expecting significant growth, especially in the wireless area.<br><br>2. The five areas I need to group into contiguous blocks that can be summarized include the StadiumCompany devices, Team devices, Luxury Suites devices, Data Center Devices, and the four remote sites.<br><br>3. All of the end user PCs will use DHCP for addressing. I need to statically address the infrastructure devices, including the two core switches, six distribution switches and all of the access switches. I will also need static addresses for the servers and the wireless LAN controllers.<br><br>4. I will put my campus DHCP server in the Data Center. I will use the Cisco ISRs at the remote sites for DHCP. I think I can use the DHCP on the wireless controller to assign addresses to the wireless end devices. I will have to figure out what ranges to assign to each DHCP server.<br><br>]]></text>
