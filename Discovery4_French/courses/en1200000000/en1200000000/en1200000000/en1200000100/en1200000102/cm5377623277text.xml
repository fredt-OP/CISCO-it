<text><![CDATA[More and more, we interact and share ideas using a network built on IP services.   Behind the scenes, the architects of this dramatic change in the way we communicate are the network designers.  
We need converged networks that can scale to accommodate our increasing demands for new services.  We expect the network applications and services we use to be available and secure.  And, as the underlying networks become more complex, supporting and managing these networks becomes a top priority.  We rely on network designers to ensure our networks can meet our expectations.
A well designed network protects our investment in networking technology and provides our organizations with a competitive edge.  Career opportunities in network design are growing quickly, as organizations large and small realize the importance of building networks on a solid foundation of good design.]]></text>
