			<question><![CDATA[The stadium needs wireless connectivity for handheld devices; however, the concrete structure is causing some dead spots in certain areas of the walkway ramps in initial testing designs. The Access Points selected do not have an antenna option that can provide the necessary coverage. Changing the Access Point model or increasing the number of Access Points in the design will significantly increase the cost. Which two design constraints will cause the designer to have to make a trade-off in the wireless coverage in the press box?  (Choose two.)]]></question>

						<intro/><question><![CDATA[When the players and coaches are checking email on their handheld devices, they frequently lose connectivity and have to reconnect to the network. The problem is that quality of service (QoS) needs to be implemented in the network design, but the technical staff members are not trained in QoS and there is not enough money to hire a consultant. What two design constraints are being affected? (Choose two.)]]></question><choices>
