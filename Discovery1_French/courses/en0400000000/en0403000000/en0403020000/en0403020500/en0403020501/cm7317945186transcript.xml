<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Diagram 1, Animation<br><br>Human Communication<br>The diagram depicts a man and a woman communicating with each other.  The woman starts the conversation with a sentence that is spoken very rapidly with no separation between words.  The man receives this message and replies,  I cannot understand.  The woman receives this information and repeats the message, speaking at the correct speed. The man receives the information again, and this time he understands the message.<br><br>Computer Communication<br><br>The diagram depicts the communication between two computers. Computer 1 has an image it wants to send to Computer 2 located on the network.  Computer 1 sends the image to Computer 2 as a complete transmission, which is one block of information.  It sends this stream of information to Computer 2 who receives it and replies,  I cannot understand the data you sent me as it is not formatted correctly or in the appropriate sizing blocks for me to understand. Computer 1 takes in this message from Computer 2 and resizes the image into smaller blocks of Information. The smaller blocks are re-assembled at the destination, or on Computer 2 in this case, so the image can be viewed as a single entity. <br>]]></content-text></brief>
