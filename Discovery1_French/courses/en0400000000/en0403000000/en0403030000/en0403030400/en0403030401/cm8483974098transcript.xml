<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Two Diagrams <br>Diagram 1, Image<br>The diagram depicts the structure of an Ethernet frame.  Listed below, from left to right, is the structure of a frame:<br><br>Structure of the Ethernet Frame<br>Preamble, 7 bytes  Defines pattern of alternating 1 and 0 bits used to synchronize timing.<br>Start of Frame Delimiter (SFD), 1 byte. Marks the end of the timing information and start of the frame.<br>Destination MAC Address, 6 bytes. Contains the destination MAC address (receiver). The destination MAC address can be unicast, multicast, or broadcast.<br>Source MAC Address, 6 bytes. Contains the source MAC address (sender). This is the address of the Ethernet node that transmitted the data.<br>Length/Type, 2 bytes. Supports two different uses. A type value indicates which protocol will receive data. The length indicates the number of bytes of data that follows this field.<br>Encapsulated Data, 46 to 1500 bytes. The payload and sizing requirements stipulate between 64 to 1518 bytes for the entire Ethernet frame.<br>Frame Check Sequence (FCS), 4 bytes. Contains a four byte value that is created by the device that sends the frame and is recalculated by the destination device to check for damage to the frame.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
