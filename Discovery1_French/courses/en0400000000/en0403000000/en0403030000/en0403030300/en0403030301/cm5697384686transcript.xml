The PC's have been named H1 through H4 and have MAC (Media Access Control) addresses assigned as shown in the list below:<br>H1 AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA<br>H2 BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB<br>H3 CC:CC:CC:CC:CC:CC<br>H4 DD:DD:DD:DD:DD:DD<br>H1 is the source, and H3 is the destination. A speech bubble above H1 says, I need to send information to H3. The message transmits to all hosts on the network. There is a text box indicating the parameters of the framing of the transmission, as listed below: <br>Frame parameters<br>Frame Addressing (next 2 items)<br>Destination Address CC:CC:CC:CC:CC:CC<br>Source Address AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA<br>Data encapsulated data<br><br>All machines on the network reply in speech bubbles.
