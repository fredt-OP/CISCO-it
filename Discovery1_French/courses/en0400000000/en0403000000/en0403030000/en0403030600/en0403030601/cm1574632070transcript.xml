Network 192.168.200.0 has four computers named H1 through H4 and have been assigned the addresses 192.168.200.1 through 192.168.200.4 respectively. Network 192.168.1.0 has four connected computers and they have been named H5 through H8 and have been assigned the addresses 192.168.1.1 through 192.168.1.4 respectively.
