<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Diagram 3, Activity<br><br>The diagram depicts an activity in which you must determine how the router forwards a packet based on the source and destination IP address in the frame (encapsulated IP packet) and the information in the route table. <br><br>Route Table<br>The route table entries do not change and are as follows:<br><br>Type Network PortNext Hop Metric<br>C192.168.3.0/24 Ethernet 0/0--0/0<br>C172.16.1.0/24 Ethernet 0/1--0/0<br>C10.5.5.0/24 Ethernet 0/2--0/0<br><br>Frame<br>In the activity, random practice problems are generated with different source and destination IP addresses in the Frame. <br><br>An example of a practice scenario includes the following frame IP address information:<br>Destination IP: 192.168.3.5<br>Source IP: 10.5.5.8<br><br>Scenarios<br><br>One. What is the default gateway address used to forward this packet to the router?<br>192.168.3.1<br>172.16.1.1<br>10.5.5.1<br><br>Two. When the router receives this packet, to which interface will the router forward the packet?<br>Ethernet1/1<br>Ethernet1/2<br>Ethernet1/3<br>]]></content-text></brief>
