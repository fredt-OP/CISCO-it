<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Diagram 2, Animation<br><br>The diagram is a two-part animation. The diagram depicts three local networks joined to a router. The topology is as follows: H1 through H3 are connected to Switch 1, which in turn connects to the router. H4 through H6 are connected to Switch 2, which in turn connects to the router. H7 through H9 are connected to Switch 3, which in turn connects to the router. There are speech bubbles in the diagram, as follows:<br><br>The first part shows the step to send a packet from one host to another host on the local network. <br><br>LOCAL NETWORK<br><br>H1 says, I need to send a packet to IP address 192.168.1.3. That IP is in my local network.<br><br>The IP and MAC addresses are in my ARP table, I will forward it directly.<br><br>Note that the packet does not leave the local network.<br><br>The second part of the animation shows the steps to send a packet from a host on one local network to a host on a remote local network:<br><br>REMOTE NETWORK<br><br>H1 says, I need to send a packet to IP address 192.168.2.1 (H4). That IP is not in my local network. This packet must be sent to my default gateway for forwarding. I have the default gateways IP and MAC address in my ARP table.<br><br>Router 1 says, This host (H4) is on a network directly connected on one of my other interfaces. I will check my ARP table. There he is, now I can forward the packet.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
