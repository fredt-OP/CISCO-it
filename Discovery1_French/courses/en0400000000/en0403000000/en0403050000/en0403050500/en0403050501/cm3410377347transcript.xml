<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Two Diagrams<br>Diagram1, Interactive<br>The diagram depicts two networks, a network that has multiple local networks and a network that is a single local network. The topology for each of these networks is as follows:<br>Multiple Local Network<br>The router is at the center of this topology with three switches directly connected to the router. Switch 1 has three computers connected, H1 through H3, and a network address of 192.168.1.0. Switch 2 has three computers connected, H4 through H6, and a network address of 192.168.2.0. The final network has Switch 3 with three hosts connected, H7 through H9, and a network address of 192.168.3.0. The router acts as the joining point for the three networks.<br>Single Local Network<br>The single local network consists of three switches and nine hosts. The router has been removed. Switch 1 is directly connected to Switch 3. Switch 2 is also directly connected to Switch 3. Switch 1 has three computers connected, H1 through H3. Switch 2 has three computers connected, H4 through H6, and Switch 3 has three connected, H7 through H9. The network address assigned to this network is 192.168.1.0. All hosts share this network number.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
