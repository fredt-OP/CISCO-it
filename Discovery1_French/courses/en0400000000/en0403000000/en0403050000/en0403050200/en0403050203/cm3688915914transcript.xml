<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Diagram 3, Animation<br>The diagram depicts a network with a central router and three switches attached. Each switch has a number of hosts attached. Connected to the first switch are hosts H1 through H3. This switch connects to the router FA0/0 interface. The routers FA0/2 connects to another switch with host H4 attached. Another connection from the router connects to a switch with hosts H5 and H6 attached. The IP addresses are as follows:<br>H1 10.0.0.1<br>H2 10.0.0.2 <br>H3 10.0.0.3<br>H4 192.168.1.2<br>H5 172.16.0.2 <br>H6 172.16.0.1 <br><br>H1 sends a packet out onto the network for the H4 client with the address 192.168.1.2. First, the message traverses the network based on forwarding decisions made by the switch. The switch examines the MAC address table to see if the entry is on the local network. If the MAC is not found, the packet is then forwarded to the default gateway. The router examines the routing table to see if the IP address entry exists, and whether there is a path to the destination network in the routing table. Once the path has been determined, the router sends the packet out of the appropriate interface so the message reaches the destination IP 192.168.1.2. If host H1 sends a broadcast message, all hosts connected to the switch on the 10.0.0.0 network receives the message. The router connected to this switch also receives the message but does not forward the broadcast. The message is discarded at the router.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
