<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Three Diagrams<br><br>Diagram 1, Animation<br>The diagram depicts an IP packet encapsulated in an Ethernet Frame. <br>The Ethernet frame consists of the destination MAC address (moving left to right within the frame), followed by the source MAC address. The destination and source MAC address sections of the frame are read by Layer 2 devices, such as a switch or bridge. <br>The source and destination MAC addresses are as follows:<br>Source MAC address AA:AA:AA:AA:AA:AA.  <br>Destination MAC BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB<br>The next fields in the frame are the destination IP and the source IP addresses. Depending on the subnet mask, some bits belong to the network portion and some belong to the host portion.  <br>For example, with the address 192.168.1.5, the first three octets (192.168.1) belong to the network, and .5 belongs to the host. <br>In addition to the source and destination IP address, the IP packet contains the user data. The data is also known as the payload. The last part of the Ethernet frame is the trailer. The trailer finishes the encapsulation of the frame.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
