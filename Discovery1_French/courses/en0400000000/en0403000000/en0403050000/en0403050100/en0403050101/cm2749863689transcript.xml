<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Single Diagram<br><br>Diagram 1, Interactive<br><br>The diagram depicts four boxes, each labeled with following headings: Broadcast Containment, Security, Locations, and Logical Grouping. More information is given below.<br><br>Broadcast Containment<br><br>Routers in the Distribution Layer can limit broadcasts to the local network where they need to be heard. Although broadcasts are necessary, too many hosts connected on the same local network can generate excessive broadcast traffic and slow down the network.<br><br>Security<br><br>Routers in the Distribution Layer can separate and protect certain groups of computers where confidential information resides. Routers can also hide the addresses of internal computers from the outside world to help prevent attacks and control who can get into or out of the local network.<br><br>Locations<br><br>Routers in the Distribution Layer can be used to interconnect local networks at various locations of an organization that are geographically separated.<br><br>Logical Grouping<br><br>Routers in the Distribution Layer can be used to logically group users, such as departments within a company, who have common needs or for access to resources.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
