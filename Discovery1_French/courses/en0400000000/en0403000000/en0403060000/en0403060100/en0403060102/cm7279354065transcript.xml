Included in the physical topology is the physical location of devices, such as routers, switches, and hosts, as well as how all devices are interconnected. Also pertinent to design is the location and length of all cable runs, and hardware configuration of end devices such as hosts and servers.<br>Logical Topology<br>The logical topology defines the addressing scheme used to name and address all machines on the network. Logical topology includes the IP addressing scheme, naming scheme, sharing configuration, permissions, and the location and size of broadcast and collision domains.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
