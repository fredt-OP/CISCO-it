<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Two Diagrams <br>Diagram 1, Interactive<br>The diagram depicts a man sitting at a desk in front of computer planning the physical topology and logical addressing scheme for a network. Network planning is crucial to installing a good network. <br>A network plan starts with the gathering of information about how the network will be used, as follows:<br>Number and type of hosts to be connected to network.<br>Where are the end users located? What type of hardware are they using? Where are the servers, printers, and other devices located?<br>Applications to be used. <br>What type of applications are running on the network?<br>Data and devices to be shared Who requires access to which files and network resources, such as printers?<br>Bandwidth requirements (speed) What is an acceptable speed for the end users? Do all users require the same throughput? What affect will the applications have on the throughput?<br>Security and privacy considerations. <br>Is the data being moved on the network of a personal or sensitive nature? Could unauthorized access to this information cause harm to anyone?<br>Reliability and up time expectations. <br>How important is the network? Does it need to be available 100% of the time, (this is known as up time)? How much downtime can be tolerated?<br>Connectivity requirements, including wired and wireless Do any or all of the end users require wireless connectivity?<br>]]></content-text></brief>
