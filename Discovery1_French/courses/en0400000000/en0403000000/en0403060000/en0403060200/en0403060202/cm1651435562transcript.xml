<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Diagram 2, Animated Simulation<br>The diagram depicts Packet Tracer in use. A prototype network topology is being designed, captured as a flash movie.  As the file plays, several network devices are added to the blank topology work area. The scenario that the network is being planned for is a web server and two computers linked to the Ethernet switch portion of a Linksys WRT300N wireless router and Access Point (AP). These network devices are as follows, a Linksys WRT300N Wireless Router and 3 computers. After the network devices are added, the links between the devices are configured in terms of the media being used. Each host is connected to the switch portion of the WRT300N so a wired FastEthernet link icon is selected and used to connect the devices. Now that the physical topology is complete, the logical topology needs to be configured.  Each network device on the page is selected and an appropriate IP address, subnet mask and default gateway is configured.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
