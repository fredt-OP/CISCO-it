<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Two Diagrams<br><br>Diagram 1, Interactive<br><br>The diagram depicts several networking devices, including a PC, scanner, local printer, hub, switch, network printer, laptop, server, and webcam. There is a brief description about each of the categories that the devices belong to.  <br><br>Peripherals<br>Shared peripheral devices do not communicate directly on the network. Instead, peripherals rely on their connected host to perform all network operations. Examples of peripherals are cameras, scanners, and locally attached printers. Printers and scanners can be shared.<br><br>Hosts<br>Hosts send and receive user traffic. A host is a generic name for most end user devices. A host has an IP network address. Examples of hosts are personal computers and network attached printers.<br><br>Network Devices<br>Networking devices connect other devices, mainly hosts. These devices move and control network traffic. Examples of network devices include hubs, switches, and routers.<br><br>Network Media<br>Network media provides connections between hosts and network devices. Network media can be wired, such as copper and fiber optic, or use wireless technologies.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
