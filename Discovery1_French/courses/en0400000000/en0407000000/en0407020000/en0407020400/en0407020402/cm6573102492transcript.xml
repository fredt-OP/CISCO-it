<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Diagram 2, Animation<br><br>The diagram depicts a circle. Inside are three laptops (H1, H2, H3) and an access point, all connected via WI FI. H1 needs to send information to H2. H1 sends a Request to Send (RTS) to the access point. The access point sends out a Clear to Send (CTS) to all. H1 then sends the data to H2 through the AP. H1 then sends an acknowledgment to the access point (release channel). The access point then sends a message to all stating that the channel is free again.<br><br>There are speech bubbles in the diagram, as follows:<br><br>H1, "I have information to send to H2. I must ask permission to talk on this channel."<br>AP, "No one else is using this channel. I will grant permission to H1 to use it."<br>H1, "Transmission complete. I must release the channel so that someone else can use it."<br>]]></content-text></brief>
