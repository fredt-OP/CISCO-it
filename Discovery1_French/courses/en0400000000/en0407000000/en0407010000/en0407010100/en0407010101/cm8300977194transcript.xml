<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Four Diagrams<br>Diagram 1, Image<br>The diagram depicts the electromagnetic spectrum and its breakdown in terms of wavelengths from high frequency waves (Gamma) to low frequency waves (Radio). The diagram also shows the colors in the narrow visible light spectrum between ultraviolet and Infrared. The major segments of the electromagnetic spectrum are listed below:<br>Gamma Rays: Wavelength = 10 to the minus 14 to 10 to the minus 12 meters.<br>X rays: Wavelength = 10 to the minus 12 to 10 to the minus 10 meters.<br>Ultraviolet Rays: Wavelength = 10 to the minus 10 to 10 to the minus 8 meters.<br>Visible Light: Wavelength = 10 to the minus 8 to 10 to the minus 6 meters (approximately 400 to 800 nanometers). Optical spectrum colors are as follows, from left to right in the diagram: Violet, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red.<br>Infrared Rays: Wavelength = 10 to the minus 6 to 10 to the minus 4 meters.<br>Radar:  Wavelength = 10 to the minus 4 to 10 to the minus 2 meters.<br>TV and FM Radio:  Wavelength = 1 meter.<br>Shortwave:  Wavelength = 10 to power of 2 meters.<br>A M Radio:  Wavelength = 10 to the power of 4 meters.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
