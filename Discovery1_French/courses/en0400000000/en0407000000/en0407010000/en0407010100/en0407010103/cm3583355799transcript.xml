<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Diagram 3, Image<br>The diagram depicts a range of frequencies, from extremely low, such as audio, to extremely high, such as X Rays. <br>The RF (Radio Frequency) spectrum that is used for wireless communication ranges from Medium to Super High, and also includes infrared in the light spectrum.  <br>The RF bands that have been set aside for use with cordless phones and wireless LANs are described in the text. Their place in the overall spectrum is in the Ultra High to Super High RF range.<br>The names and relative sizes of the frequency ranges are depicted as boxes from left, audio, to right, X Rays. The diagram identifies the frequency point on the range for the following communication technologies:<br>Audio Extremely, Very Low, Low<br>A M Broadcast Medium to High<br>Shortwave Radio Medium<br>FM Broadcast Very High<br>Television Very High to Ultra High<br>Cellular (840 MHz) Ultra High<br>Cordless Phones (902 to 928 MHz) Ultra High<br>NPCS (930 MHz) Ultra High<br>IEEE 802.11b/g/n Wireless LANs (2.400 to 2.483 GHz)<br>IEEE 802.11a and HiperLAN/2 Wireless LANs (5.725 to 5.850 GHz)<br>Infrared Wireless LAN Infrared spectrum<br>Visible Light, Ultraviolet, and X ray light are at the right end of the spectrum.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
