<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Single Diagram<br><br>Diagram 1, Interactive<br><br>The diagram depicts four small images: one of eyes, one of a nose, one of a hand, and one of an ear, indicating the senses that you can use when you troubleshoot. A brief description of each is given below:<br><br>The Sense of Sight<br>Vision is used to detect problems such as improperly connected or poorly constructed cables, including: <br><br>cables which are not connected <br>cables connected to the wrong port <br>loose cable connections <br>damaged cables and connectors <br>use of the wrong type of cable <br><br>Vision also allows us to view the condition and function of various network devices with L E D's.<br><br>The Sense of Smell<br>Smell can alert troubleshooters to components which are overheating. The smell of burning insulation or components is very distinct and is a sure sign that something is seriously wrong.<br><br>The Sense of Touch<br>Troubleshooters can use touch to feel for overheated components as well as to detect mechanical problems with devices such as cooling fans. These devices usually create a small vibration in the component that can be detected using touch. The absence of this vibration or the presence of excessive amounts of vibration can indicate that the cooling fan has failed or is about to do so.<br><br>The Sense of Hearing<br>Hearing is used to detect major problems such as electrical issues and the proper operation of cooling fans and disc drives. All devices have characteristic sounds and any change from the normal sounds usually indicates a problem of some sort.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
