<text><![CDATA[<font size="14"><b>There are several issues to check for when troubleshooting wired and wireless networks.</b><br/><br/><ul><li>LED lights are used to indicate the current state or activity of a piece of equipment or connection. </li><br/><li>For wired devices, check physical connectivity and cabling issues including:  wrong cable type, bad termination, physical damage, and port placement.</li><br/><li>For a wireless client, connectivity problem such as: A/B/G/N compatibility, overlapping channels, signal strength, and interference should be examined. Also, check the SSID, authentication and encryption settings.</li><br/><li>On both wired and wireless clients, check the IP configuration of the client, including IP address, subnet mask, default gateway and DNS information. </li><br/><li>Verify connectivity between the ISR and the ISP by checking the router status page in the ISR to ensure that an IP address is assigned by the ISP and the connection is good.<br/></li></ul></font>]]></text>
