The resources described are as follows:<br>Documentation: Good documentation can save a great deal of time and effort by directing the troubleshooting to the most likely cause of the problem.  It can also provide the technical information required to isolate, verify, and correct the issue. The documentation provided with many networking devices, however, often does not provide sufficient information to troubleshoot anything except the most basic issues.<br>FAQ's: Most manufacturers provide a series of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's) about the product or technology on their website. Usually based on previous requests for help, FAQ's are a good source of current information, and should be consulted whenever possible.<br>Internet: With the increase availability of the Internet and development of support forums, troubleshooters can now obtain assistance from people around the world in real time. <br>Colleagues: Colleagues are a wealth of information; there is no substitute for troubleshooting experience.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
