<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Diagram 2, Image<br><br>The diagram depicts two scenarios for configuring an IP address. The methods are manual or static, and automatic or dynamic assignment.<br>Manually configuring, also known as statically configuring, the IP address is usually done by the administrator that assigns the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway addresses. These addresses are configured at the host computer and are not changed, unless done so by the administrator.<br><br>Automatic assignment, also known as dynamic assignment, usually takes place when a server is assigned as the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. The server waits for network activity from the client and assigns an IP address from a range of addresses specified at the time of configuring the server. Once the client is installed on the network, it requests an IP address, and the server assigns one. There are speech bubbles in the diagram, as follows:<br><br>In the manual configuration diagram, the computer says, I will assign the IP configuration.<br><br>In the automatic configuration diagram, the server says, I will assign the IP configuration.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
