<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Diagram 2, Interactive<br><br>The diagram depicts the operating system software components between the user and the computer hardware. A three part sphere is shown with two outer rings and an inner core. Each area of the sphere is labeled from the outside ring inwards. The outermost ring is labeled the shell, the second ring is labeled the kernel, and the inner most area is labeled the hardware. The user interacts with the shell, which interacts with the kernel, which then controls the computer hardware. Placing the mouse over the shell outer ring displays the two types of shell interfaces: C L I and G U I. Each of the three areas of the sphere has a description, as follows:<br><br>SHELL<br>The user interface that allows users to request specific tasks from the computer. These requests can be made either through the C L I or G U I interface.<br>                      <br>KERNEL<br>Communicates between the hardware and the software of a computer and manages how hardware resources are used to meet software requirements.<br><br>HARDWARE<br>The physical components of a computer system, including underlying electronics.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
