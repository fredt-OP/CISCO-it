<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Diagram 2, Interactive<br><br>The diagram depicts several types of firewall products, as follows: <br><br>Cisco Security Appliances<br>Dedicated firewall devices with specialized computers that do not have peripherals or hard drives. Appliance based firewalls can inspect traffic faster and are less prone to failure.<br><br>Server based Firewall<br>Firewall applications that generally provide a solution that combines an S P I firewall and access control, based on IP address or application. Server based firewalls can be less secure than dedicated, appliance based firewalls because of the security weaknesses of the general purpose OS.<br><br>Linksys Wireless Router with Integrated Firewall<br>Most home integrated routers have built in basic firewall capabilities that support packet, application, and website filtering. Higher end routers that run special operating systems, like Cisco Internetwork Operating System (I O S), also have firewall capabilities that can be configured.<br><br>Personal Firewall<br>Client side firewalls that typically filter using S P I. The user may be prompted to allow certain applications to connect, or may define a list of automatic exceptions. Personal firewalls are often used when a host device is connected directly to an ISP modem. It may interfere with Internet access if not properly configured. It is not recommended to use more than one personal firewall at a time, since they can conflict with one another.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
