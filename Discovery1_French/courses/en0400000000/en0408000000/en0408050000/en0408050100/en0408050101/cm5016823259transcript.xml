<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Four Diagrams, Slider Graphic<br><br>Diagram 1, Image<br><br>The diagram depicts a social engineer and an unsuspecting employee. A Social Engineer sitting at her workstation says "Hi, this is Amy from the help desk. We need to upgrade the software on your computer after work hours. What is your user ID and password? You can change the password tomorrow when you log in."<br><br>Unsuspecting employee at X Y Z Corporation sitting at her workstation says "Ok, my user ID and password are."<br><br>Diagram 1 text<br><br>This chapter discussed various networking threats, such as information theft, Identity theft, data loss and manipulation, and disruption of service.<br>Hackers are intruders who gain access to a network through software vulnerabilities, hardware attacks, or through weaknesses of individuals.<br>Attacks can come from internal and external sources. Internal attacks account for approximately 70% of security incidents.<br>Social engineering is a group of techniques used to deceive internal users into performing specific actions or revealing confidential information. <br>Three types of social engineering include pre texting, phishing, and vishing. <br><br>Diagram 2, Image<br><br>The diagram depicts security threats, such as viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, tracking cookies, spam, and denial of service.<br><br>Diagram 2 text<br><br>There are other threats to the security of networks and computers in addition to social engineering attacks.<br>Viruses are programs that once activated spreads by modifying other programs or files, causing damage to files, or erasing them completely.<br>A worm is similar to a virus except it runs independently and spreads by resending itself as an email attachment or part of a network message.<br>A Trojan horse is a program that appears legitimate. Once initiated, it can damage a hard drive or create a back door into a system allowing hackers to gain access.<br><br>Diagram 3, Image<br><br>The diagram depicts security measures, such as firewall, spam filter, patches, and updates, antivirus, popup blocker, and antispyware.<br><br><br>Diagram 3 text <br><br>Effective network security comes from a combination of products and services, combined with a thorough security policy and a commitment to adhere to that policy. <br>A security policy should include identification and authentication policies, password policies, acceptable use policies, remote access policies, and incident handling procedures. <br>All users of the network must support and follow the security policy in order for it to be effective. <br>Tools and applications used in securing a network include the following:<br>Software patches and updates<br>Virus protection<br>Spyware protection<br>Spam blockers<br>Popup blockers<br>Firewalls<br>Keep software applications up to date with the latest security patches and updates to help deter threats.<br>Antivirus software, installed on every computer, detects and removes known viruses, worms and Trojan horses. <br>Antispam software identifies spam and places it into a junk folder or deletes it.<br><br>Diagram 4, Image<br><br>The diagram depicts a firewall protecting an internal computer. <br><br>Diagram 4 text<br><br>A firewall controls the traffic between networks and helps prevent unauthorized access. Firewall products use various techniques for determining what is permitted or denied access to a network. <br>Packet filtering controls access based on IP or MAC addresses<br>Application/website filtering controls access based on the application. <br>Stateful Packet Inspection (SP I) ensures incoming packets are legitimate responses to requests from internal hosts. SP I can recognize and filter out attacks, such as D o S.<br>A DMZ is an area of the network that is accessible to both internal and external users<br>If the wireless access point is unsecured, anyone who connects to it is considered part of the internal network, and is on the protected side of the firewall. <br>Vulnerability analysis tools, such as security scanners, help identify areas where attacks might occur and offer guidance on steps that can be taken.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
