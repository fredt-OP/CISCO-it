<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Diagram 3, Image<br><br>The diagram depicts an instructional table with safety and best practice recommendations. They are listed below:<br><br>Use an antistatic mate and grounding wrist strap.<br>Use antistatic bags to store and move computer components. Do not put more than one component in each bag because stacking them can cause some of the components to break of become loose.<br>Do not remove or install components while the computer is powered on.<br>Ground often by touching a piece of bare metal on the chassis or power supply. This will prevent static charges from building up.<br>Work on a bare floor because carpets can build up static charges.<br>Hold cards by the edges to avoid touching chips or the edge connectors on the expansion cards.<br>Do not touch chips or expansion boards with a magnetized screwdriver.<br>Turn off the computer before moving it. This is to protect the hard drive, which is spinning when the computer is turned on.<br>Keep installation/maintenance CD's and disks away from magnetic fields, heat, and cold.<br>Do not place a circuit board of any kind onto a conductive surface, especially a metal foil. The Lithium and Nickel Cadmium (Ni cad) batteries used on boards may short out.<br>Do not use a pencil or metal tipped instrument to change DIP switches or to touch components.  The graphite in the pencil is conductive and could easily cause damage.<br>Do not allow anyone who is not properly grounded to touch or hand off computer components. This is true even when working with a lab partner. When passing components, always touch hands first to neutralize any charges.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
