<component id="tipBody"><text><![CDATA[Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) occurs when two objects at different potentials are connected together through a conductor. This allows electrons to flow between the two objects in an attempt to balance out the charge. This is very similar to connecting two containers of water together with a pipe. The level of water in the two containers will eventually become the same. Unfortunately the components that make up a computer are very sensitive to this flow of electrons and great care must be taken to prevent it from occurring.]]></text>
