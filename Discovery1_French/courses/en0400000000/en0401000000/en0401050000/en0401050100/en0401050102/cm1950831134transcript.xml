<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts an antistatic strap that acts as a grounding device when attached to a grounding post or desk. Grounding yourself before entering the internals of a computer system unit helps to ensure that ESD does not damage vital components inside the machine.<br><br>More Information Popup<br>Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) occurs when two objects at different potentials are connected together through a conductor. This allows electrons to flow between the two objects in an attempt to balance out the charge. This is very similar to connecting two containers of water together with a pipe. The level of water in the two containers will eventually become the same. Unfortunately, the components that make up a computer are very sensitive to this flow of electrons and great care must be taken to prevent it from occurring.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
