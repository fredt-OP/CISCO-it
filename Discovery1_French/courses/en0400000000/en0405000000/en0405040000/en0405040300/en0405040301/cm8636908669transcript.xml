<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Two Diagrams<br><br>Diagram 1, Animation<br>The diagram depicts the network address translation that occurs when packets pass between the local-area network side and the external network side of a router. The router translates the private source address to a public address to send it onto the Internet. To do this, it uses an address translation table where port numbers are used to keep track of where packets are destined, and the source. <br>In this example, a small network of three PC's is connected to a Linksys wireless router. The Linksys router is connected to an external router, which in turn is connected to a webserver. The PC's have IP addresses 192.168.1.2 through 4. <br>Host 192.168.1.2 sends a request to the web server 200.100.75.99 via the Linksys router (192.168.1.1). As the packet passes to the gateway, the source address is changed to that of the Linksys router external interface (200.100.50.2) and the packet is passed on through the network. <br>The web server responds to the Linksys router. Because the port is known to be that of the request from 192.168.1.2, the packet is translated back to that address.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
