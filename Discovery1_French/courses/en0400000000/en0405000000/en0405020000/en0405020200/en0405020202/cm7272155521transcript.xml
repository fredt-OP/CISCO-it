Switch 1 has  three PC's attached (PC1, PC2, PC3). Switch 2  has three PC's attached (PC4, PC5, PC6). Switch 3 has four PC's attached (PC7, PC8, PC9, PC10).<br><br>Switch 1.<br>PC1 Address - 10.0.0.1.<br>PC2 Address - 10.0.0.2.<br>PC3 Address - 10.0.0.3.<br><br>Switch 2.<br>PC4 Address - 10.0.0.4.<br>PC5 Address - 10.0.0.5.<br>PC6 Address - 10.0.0.6.<br><br>Switch 3.<br>PC7 Address - 10.0.0.7.<br>PC8 Address - 10.0.0.8.<br>PC9 Address - 10.0.0.9.<br>PC10 Address - 10.0.0.10.<br><br>Network 3 has two switches (Switch 1, Switch 2). Switch 1 has three PC's attached (PC1, PC2, PC3). Switch 2 has four PC's attached (PC4, PC5, PC6, PC7).<br><br>Switch 1.<br>PC1 Address - 172.16.0.1.<br>PC2 Address - 172.16.0.6.<br>PC3 Address - 172.16.0.7.<br><br>Switch 2.<br>PC4 Address - 172.16.0.2.<br>PC5 Address - 172.16.0.3.<br>PC6 Address - 172.16.0.4.<br>PC7 Address - 172.16.0.5.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
