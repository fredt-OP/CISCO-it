<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Two Diagrams<br><br>Diagram 1, Image<br><br>The diagram depicts two network clouds. Each cloud contains a similar network with three hosts connected to a switch. Each switch connects to a router. The routers in each cloud connect to each other. Each device has its own IP address.<br><br>The key concept is that in the first cloud all devices are on the 192.168.18.0 network, and all devices in the second cloud are on network 192.168.5.0. <br><br>More Information Popup<br>Multiple logical networks on one physical network: With IP addressing, multiple logical networks can exist on one physical network, if the network portion of their host addresses is different. Example: three hosts on a single physical local network have the same network portion to their IP address (192.168.50), and three other hosts have a different network portion (192.168.70). The hosts with the same network number in their IP addresses will be able to communicate with each other, but will not be able to communicate with the other hosts without the use of routing. In this case, we have one physical network and two logical IP networks.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
