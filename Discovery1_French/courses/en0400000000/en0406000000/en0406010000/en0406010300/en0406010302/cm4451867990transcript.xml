<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Diagram 2, Animation<br><br>The diagram is the same as the previous diagram. The animation depicts the use of TCP to send packets to a FTP server. Host 1 sends a packet to the FTP server. The FTP server sends an acknowledgement stating that it received the packet. Host 1 sends more packet(s) to the FTP server. The packet is lost. After a timeout, Host 1 retransmits the packet to the FTP server. The FTP server receives the packet and sends an acknowledgement to Host 1. There are speech bubbles in the diagram, as follows:<br><br>Host 1 says, I am sending a file with FTP. TCP will make sure it is received.<br>FTP server says, I received the first three. I will send an acknowledgement.<br>Host 1 says, I received an acknowledgement. I will send the next group.<br>FTP server says, I missed the second group. I will send no acknowledgement.<br>Host 1 says, I received no acknowledgement. I will resend the last group.<br>FTP server says, I received the next group. I will send an acknowledgement.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
