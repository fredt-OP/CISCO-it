<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Five Diagrams<br><br>Diagram 1, Interactive<br><br>The diagram depicts the functionality of the layers of the Open System Interconnect (O S I) Model.<br>Application Layer<br>Defines interfaces between application software and network communication functions.<br>Provides standardized services, such as file transfer between systems.<br>Presentation Layer<br>Standardizes user data formats for use between different types of systems.<br>Encodes and decodes user data; encrypts and decrypts data; compresses and decompresses data.<br>Session Layer<br>Manages user sessions and dialogues.<br>Maintains logical links between systems.<br>Transport Layer<br>Manages end-to-end message delivery over the network. <br>Can provide reliable and sequential packet delivery through error recovery and flow control mechanisms.<br>Network Layer<br>Routes packets according to unique network device addresses. <br>Data Link Layer<br>Defines procedures for operating the communication links.<br>Detects and corrects frame transmit errors. <br>Physical Layer<br>Defines physical means of sending data over network devices. <br>Interfaces between network medium and devices.<br>Defines optical, electrical, and mechanical characteristics.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
