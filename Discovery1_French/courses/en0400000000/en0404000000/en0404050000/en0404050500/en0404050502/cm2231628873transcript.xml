<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Diagram 2, Interactive<br><br>The diagram identifies various wiring faults, including reversed pair, split pair, open, and short, and gives a brief description of each.<br>Reversed Pair<br>The reversed pair fault occurs when a wire pair is correctly installed on one connector, but reversed on the other connector. For example, if the white/green wire is terminated on pin 1, and the green wire is terminated on pin 2 at one end of a cable, but reversed at the other end, then the cable has a reversed pair fault.<br>Split Pair<br>A split pair fault occurs when one wire from one pair is switched with one wire from a different pair at both ends. Look carefully at the pin numbers in the graphic to detect the wiring fault. A split pair creates two transmit or receive pairs, each with two wires that are not twisted together. This mixing hampers the cross-cancellation process and makes the cable more susceptible to crosstalk and interference.<br>Open<br>An error in wiring that is caused by a break in the continuity of a circuit.<br>Short<br>A short occurs when the copper portions of two wires touch each other.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
