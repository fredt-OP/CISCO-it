In 1999, IEEE began developing the standard for delivering power over Ethernet. Today, that standard is known as IEEE 8 0 2 dot 3af-2003. It is used to send 48 volts DC along with Ethernet data on 4-pair UTP or STP cable. Power over Ethernet (P o E) allows network engineers to have flexibility in the placement of endpoint devices, such as wireless access points, video cameras, and IP telephones, because there is no need to have an electrical power outlet near the device.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
