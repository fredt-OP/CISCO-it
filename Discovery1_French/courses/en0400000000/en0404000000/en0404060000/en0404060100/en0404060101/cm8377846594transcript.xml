In order to access the Internet you must connect through an ISP.<br>An ISP is a company that provides the connections and support to access the Internet.<br>ISP's support small to large geographic areas.<br>ISP's provide services, such as email, web pages, IP Telephony and DNS.<br>Individual computers and local networks connect to the ISP at a Point of Presence (POP). <br>Connection to the ISP can be done using dial up, DSL, cable, wireless, or satellite.<br><br>Diagram 2, image<br>The diagram depicts that PC + IP + ISP = Internet<br><br>Diagram 2 text<br>The most important protocol of the Internet is the Internet Protocol (IP).<br>The Internet Protocol formats data into packets that are from 46 to 1500 bytes in length, and that must contain a valid source and destination IP address.<br>IP addresses must be unique on the Internet.<br>Every ISP has a control facility for their network, known as the Network Operations Center (NOC), that usually controls traffic flow and houses services, such as email and web hosting.<br>Ping and traceroute are utilities that test connectivity to a destination device.<br><br>Diagram 3, Image<br>The diagram depicts the network cloud and devices.<br><br>Diagram 3 text<br>On network diagrams, a cloud is often used to represent the Internet without showing the details of the connections.<br>In the Internet cloud, routers are used to provide alternate paths from source to destination.<br>ISP's must be able to accept and deliver information to end users, and other ISP's, using a variety of technologies.<br>Networking devices used in ISP's are high-end, high-speed devices with redundancy.<br>An ISP must consider the physical requirements of the networking equipment and the servers it houses, such as power and air conditioning.<br><br>Diagram 4, Image<br>The diagram depicts three types of network cabling.<br><br>Diagram 4 text<br>For communication to occur a channel must be present to carry the signals. In the networked world, the medium is usually a physical cable:<br>Network cables are grouped into two categories: copper cables that carry electrical signals, and fiber-optic cables that carry light waves.<br>Copper wire, such as UTP and coaxial cable, is extremely vulnerable to both electro-magnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI).<br>Fiber optic cable is made of glass or plastic and is immune to EMI and RFI.<br>Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable is used on most Ethernet networks.<br>Coaxial cable, used frequently for cable TV and Internet, has an extremely large bandwidth capacity that allows many signals to be combined or multiplexed.<br>Fiber optic cable can provide a tremendous amount of bandwidth and is suitable for use as backbone cables.<br><br>Diagram 5 Image<br>The diagram depicts a technician working on a patch panel.<br><br>Diagram 5 text<br>Cabling standards are guidelines for the installation and testing of cables to ensure acceptable performance as technology evolves.<br>T IA/EIA twisted pair termination standards are 568A and 568B.<br>Different types of cables have different wiring schemes.<br>Common UTP cable types are straight-through, crossover, and rollover.<br>Cable testers check for continuity, open terminations, shorts, split pairs, and reversed pairs. A cable meter tests for attenuation and crosstalk.<br>Cabling best practices help to reduce the number of cable errors and problems that can be encountered, and can save a great amount of time, money, and frustration.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
