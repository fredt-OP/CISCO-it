<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Diagram 2, Interactive<br>The diagram depicts three of the most common types of cabling media used in the transmission of data across the network. Information on each of the mediums, twisted pair, coaxial cable, and fiber optic is as follows:<br><br>Twisted Pair<br>TP is one of the most commonly used cable types in networking. Wires are grouped in pairs and twisted together to reduce interference. The pairs of wires are colored so that you can identify the same wire at each end. Typically in each pair, one of the wires is a solid color, and its partner is the same color striped onto a white background.<br><br>Coaxial Cable<br>Coaxial was one of the earliest types of network cabling developed. Coaxial cable is the kind of copper cable used by cable TV companies.  Coaxial cable has a single rigid copper core that conducts the signal. This core is typically surrounded by a layer of insulation, braided metal shielding, and a protective jacket. It is used as a high-frequency transmission line to carry a high frequency or broadband signals.<br><br>Fiber Optic<br>Fiber optic cable can be made of either glass or plastic with a diameter about the same as a human hair that carry digital information at very high speeds over long distances. Since they use light instead of electricity, electrical interference does not affect the signal. Fiber optic cables have many uses as well as communications. They are also used in medical imaging, medical treatment, and mechanical engineering inspection.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
