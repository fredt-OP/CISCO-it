<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Diagram 1, Image<br><br>The diagram depicts a network cloud with the source PC at the entry point into the cloud. The source is directly connected to a switch, and then to a boundary router which acts as the gateway to the Internet, or cloud. <br>Housed within the cloud are seven routers. There are also three other boundary routers connecting generic networks to the Internet. Connected to one of the networks is the destination PC on the far side of the cloud, which indicates that the destination PC may be on the other side of the world. <br>The connections between source and destination may include different types of cabling or media to transmit on. The data leaves the source on a straight through cable to the switch. The switch forwards the data by another straight through cable to the boundary router. <br>The connections are copper cabling. Within the cloud, the data is usually transmitted by serial copper links (electrical) or fiber optic (light). When the data reaches the far side boundary router, it is converted back to an electrical signal and forwarded by a straight through cable from the router to the switch, and another straight through cable between the switch and the destination PC.  <br>The key point outlined by this diagram is that several types of cabling media are used between source and destination, and together they represent the channel.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
