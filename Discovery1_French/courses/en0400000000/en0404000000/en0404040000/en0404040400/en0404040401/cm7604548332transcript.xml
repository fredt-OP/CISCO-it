<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Diagram 1, Animation<br>The diagram depicts a fiber optic cable that has transmit and receive strands and connectors. The connectors at either end of the cable have separate Rx and Tx lines for transmission to and from the source to the destination.<br>One of the strands is cut to show a cross-section. The separate parts are identified for greater understanding of the physical components. The composition of the fiber optic cable is as follows:<br>JACKET<br>Added to protect the fiber against abrasion, solvents, and other contaminants. This outer jacket composition can vary depending on the cable usage.<br>STRENGTHENING MATERIAL<br>Surrounds the buffer, prevents the fiber cable from being stretched when it is being pulled. The material used is often the same material used to produce bulletproof vests.<br>BUFFER<br>Used to help shield the core and cladding from damage.<br>CLADDING<br>Made from slightly different chemicals than those used to create the core. It tends to act like a mirror reflecting light back into the core or the fiber. This keeps light in the core as it travels down the fiber.<br>CORE <br>The core is actually the light transmission element at the center of the optical fiber. This core is typically silica, or glass. Light pulses travel through the fiber core.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
