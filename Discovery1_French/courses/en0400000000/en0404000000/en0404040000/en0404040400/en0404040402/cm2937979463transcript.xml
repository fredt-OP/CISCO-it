<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Diagram 2, Image<br><br>The diagram depicts the two different types of fiber optic, single-mode and multimode. The characteristics that pertain to these fiber cables are as follows:<br><br>SINGLE MODE<br>Polymeric coating<br>Glass cladding is 125 microns in diameter<br>Glass core is 9 microns in diameter<br>Produces single straight path for light<br>Small core<br>Less dispersion<br>Suited for long distance applications<br>Uses lasers as the light source<br>Commonly used for campus backbones for distances of several thousand meters<br><br><br>MULTIMODE<br>Standard PVC coating<br>Glass cladding is 125 microns in diameter<br>Glass core is between 50 or 62.5 microns in diameter<br>Allows for multiple paths for light to travel<br>Larger core than single mode cable<br>Allows greater dispersion and therefore loss of signal<br>Suitable for long distance applications, but shorter than single mode cable<br>Uses L E D's as the light source<br>Commonly used with LAN's or distances of a few hundred meters within a campus network<br>]]></content-text></brief>
