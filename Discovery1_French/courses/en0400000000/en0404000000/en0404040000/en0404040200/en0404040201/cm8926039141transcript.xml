<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Diagram 1, Animation<br>The diagram depicts four different graphs, each with Time along the x axis, and Voltage along the y axis. <br>One.The first graph depicts a Pure Digital Signal, which can be represented as ON/OFF, or 0/1. In this example, a 0 is represented by 0 volts, and a 1 is represented by 3 volts.<br>Two.Plotted on the second graph is the Interference Signal, which is depicted by a sharp sudden rise and drop in the signal, with no uniformity.<br>Three.Plotted on the third graph is the Digital Signal with Interference, depicted as the digital signal, overlaid with the Interference signal. (i.e. the two signals are added together.) To visualize this, first think of a digital or binary signal that is blocked as ON or OFF. Then think of the trough and the peak of this signal. Imagine there is no stringent ON/OFF sequence, and that there is no defined 0 or 1 status. This interference signal can therefore be defined as a corrupted signal because there is no clear 0/1 translation.<br>Four.Plotted on the fourth graph is a model titled What the Computer Reads, depicted as an analog signal with lows (troughs) and highs (peaks) in the signal, representing the 0 and 1 translation within a digital signal. Due to this interference, the received signal is incorrectly interpreted at the receiver. <br>]]></content-text></brief>
