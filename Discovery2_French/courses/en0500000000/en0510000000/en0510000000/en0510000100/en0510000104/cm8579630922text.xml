<text><![CDATA[This CCNA Discovery course is the second course in the Cisco Networking Academy Discovery course series. This course, along with the <b>Networking for Home and Small Businesses</b> course, has provided you with an opportunity to gain the knowledge, skills and abilities to prepare you to take the first exam in the Cisco Certified Network Associate Series.
In order to successfully pass the certification exam, you need to review the material presented in both courses. The Cisco certification exams require a hands-on component that is presented throughout the exam as simulations, which are similar to the e-labs contained within this course.  Practice of all the hands-on labs and Packet Tracer activities is also recommended as preparation for the exam. Cisco provides an on-line certification preparation center, as well, to help ensure your success on the exam.]]></text>
