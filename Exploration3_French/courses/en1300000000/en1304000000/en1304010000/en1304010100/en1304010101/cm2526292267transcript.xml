<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the V LAN management challenge as the number of switches increases on a small- or medium-sized business network.<br><br>Small Network<br>There are three switches, S1, S2, and S3. Switch S2 port F0/1 is connected to S1 port F0/1 using a crossover cable. Switch S3 port F0/3 is connected to S1 port F0/3 using a crossover cable. <br><br>Existing V LAN's:<br>- V LAN 10 - faculty/staff<br>- V LAN 20 - students<br>- V LAN 99 - management V LAN<br>V LAN Management Task:<br>- Add V LAN 30 - guest<br><br>With a small network, the new V LAN can be added to each switch.<br><br>Larger Network<br>The larger network has many more switches. There are six Access Layer switches connected to four Distribution Layer switches, which are connected to two Core Layer switches. Each Core Layer switch is connected to a router.<br><br>Existing V LAN's: 10, 20, and 99<br>V LAN Management Task: Add V LAN 30<br><br>With a larger network, it is very time consuming to add a new V LAN to each switch.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
