<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts an overview of VTP and how it functions between two switches connected by a trunk link.<br><br>VTP Overview<br>There are three switches, S1, S2, and S3. Switch S2 port F0/1 is connected to S1 port F0/1 using a crossover cable. Switch S3 port F0/3 is connected to S1 port F0/3 using a crossover cable.<br><br>Switch S1 is a VTP server, and S2 and S3 are VTP-enabled switches. The network administrator configures V LAN 30 on S1. VTP automatically propagates the new V LAN 30 information to switches S2 and S3 using VTP. Switches S2 and S3 communicate with switch S1 using VTP advertisements.<br><br>Two switches<br>There are two switches, S1 and S2. Switch S2 port F0/1 is connected to S1 port F0/1 using a crossover cable. Switch S1 is a VTP server, and switch S2 is a VTP client.<br><br>Animation sequence:<br>One. A trunk link is added between switch S1, the VTP server, and S2, the VTP client.<br>Two. VTP advertisements are exchanged between the switches.<br>Three. Port F0/1 on switch S2 is incorrectly configured.<br>Four. Port F0/1 on switch S1 and port F0/1 on switch S2 revert to access switch ports.<br>Five. The link between switches S1 and S2 becomes an access link.<br>Six. Communication between switches S1 and S2 is lost.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
