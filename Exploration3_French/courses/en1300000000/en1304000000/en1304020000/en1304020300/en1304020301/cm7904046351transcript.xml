<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts an animation overview of the structure of a VTP frame as well as images of VTP frame details and message contents.<br><br>Overview:<br>Shown is VTP information that consists of a header field and a message field inserted into the data field of an Ethernet frame. The Ethernet frame is then encapsulated as an 8 0 2 dot 1Q trunk frame. The 8 0 2 dot 1Q frame also contains a tag with V LAN information and the FCS is recalculated. The 8 0 2 dot 1Q frames are sent between VTP Server, switch S1 and VTP Client, switch S2.<br><br>VTP Frame Details:<br>Shown are the key fields of an 8 0 2 dot 1Q VTP frame:<br><br>Destination MAC address: 01-00-0C-CC-CC-CC<br><br>LLC field: The logical link control (LLC) field contains a destination service access point (D SAP) and a source service access point (S SAP) set to the value of A A.<br><br>SNAP field: The Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP) field has an O U I set to A A A A and a type set to 2003.<br><br>VTP header field: Fields and size varies, but it always contains these VTP fields:<br>- Domain name.<br>- Domain name length.<br>- Version.<br>- Message type.<br>- Revision number.<br><br>VTP message field: Varies depending on the message type.<br><br>VTP Message Contents:<br>VTP advertisements send this global domain information:<br>- VTP domain name.<br>- Updater identity and update timestamp.<br>- MD5 digest.<br>- Frame format.<br><br>VTP advertisements send this V LAN information:<br>- V LAN ID.<br>- V LAN name.<br>- V LAN type.<br>- V LAN state.<br>- Additional V LAN configuration information specific to the V LAN type.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
