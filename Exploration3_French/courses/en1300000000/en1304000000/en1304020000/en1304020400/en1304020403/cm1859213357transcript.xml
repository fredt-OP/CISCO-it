<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts VTP transparent mode in action. <br><br>Network Topology:<br>There are four switches, S1, S2, S3, and S4 . Switch S1 is connected to S2 and S3. Switch S3 is connected to S4.<br><br>Animation Sequence:<br>Switch S3 in VTP transparent mode has been configured with V LAN's.<br>Switch S4 has been added to the network.<br><br>Switch S1 sends out a periodic summary advertisement to S3 and S4.<br><br>Switch S4 requests V LAN configuration information from S1.<br><br>Switch S1 responds to S4 with a summary advertisement.<br><br>Switch S1 also responds to S4 with subset advertisement containing V LAN configurations.<br><br>Throughout this sequence, switch S3 only forwards VTP advertisements.<br>The revision number and V LAN configurations are unchanged.<br><br>After VTP has sent all the advertisements, the VTP information in the switches is as follows:<br><br>Switch S1: <br>VTP Domain Name = cisco1<br>VTP Mode = Server<br>Config Revision = 2<br>V LAN's = 1, 2, 3<br><br>Switch S2: <br>VTP Domain Name = cisco1<br>VTP Mode = Client<br>Config Revision = 2<br>V LAN's = 1, 2, 3<br><br>Switch S3: <br>VTP Domain Name = cisco1<br>VTP Mode = Transparent<br>Config Revision = 0<br>V LAN's = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6<br><br>Switch S4: <br>VTP Domain Name = cisco1<br>VTP Mode = Client<br>Config Revision = 2<br>V LAN's = 1, 2, 3]]></content-text></brief>
