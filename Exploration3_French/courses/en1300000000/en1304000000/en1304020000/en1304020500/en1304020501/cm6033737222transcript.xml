<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a switched network without VTP pruning enabled and includes switch output from the show interfaces trunk command.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>There are three switches, S1, S2, and S3. Switch S1 port F0/1 is connected to S2 port F0/1, and switch S1 port F0/3 is connected to S3 port F0/3. Three PC's, PC1, PC2 and PC3, are connected to switch S2 on ports F0/11, F0/18, and F0/6, respectively. Three PC's, PC4, PC5, and PC6, are connected to switch S3 on ports F0/11, F0/18, and F0/6, respectively.<br><br>PC1:<br>IP address 172.17.10.21<br>V LAN 10<br><br>PC2:<br>IP address 172.17.20.22<br>V LAN 20<br><br>PC3:<br>IP address 172.17.10.23<br>V LAN 10<br><br>PC4:<br>IP address 172.17.20.24<br>V LAN 20<br><br>PC5:<br>IP address 172.17.20.25<br>V LAN 20<br><br>PC6:<br>IP address 172.17.20.26<br>V LAN 20<br><br>Switch output from the show interfaces trunk command:<br><br>Switch S1:<br>S1#show interfaces trunk<br>PortModeEncapsulationStatusNative v lan<br>FA0/1 on 8 0 2 dot 1q trunking1<br>FA0/3 on 8 0 2 dot 1q trunking1<br><br>Port V lan's allowed on trunk.<br>FA0/1 1-1005<br>FA0/3 1-1005<br><br>Port V lan's allowed and active in management domain.<br>FA0/1 1, 10, 20, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005<br>FA0/3 1, 10, 20, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005<br><br>Port V lan's in spanning tree forwarding state and not pruned.<br>FA0/1 1, 10, 20, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005<br>FA0/3 1, 10, 20, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005<br>S1#<br><br>Switch S2:<br>S2#show interfaces trunk<br>PortModeEncapsulationStatusNative v lan<br>FA0/1 on 8 0 2 dot 1q trunking1<br><br>Port V lan's allowed on trunk.<br>FA0/1 1-1005<br><br>Port V lan's allowed and active in management domain.<br>FA0/1 1, 10, 20, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005<br><br>Port V lan's in spanning tree forwarding state and not pruned.<br>FA0/1 1, 10, 20, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005<br>S2#<br><br>Switch S3:<br>S3#show interfaces trunk<br>PortModeEncapsulationStatusNative v lan<br>FA0/3 on 8 0 2 dot 1q trunking1<br><br>Port V lan's allowed on trunk.<br>FA0/3 1-1005<br><br>Port V lan's allowed and active in management domain.<br>FA0/3 1, 10, 20, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005<br><br>Port V lan's in spanning tree forwarding state and not pruned.<br>FA0/3 1, 10, 20, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005<br>S3#]]></content-text></brief>
