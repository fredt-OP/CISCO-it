<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the operation of a switched network with VTP pruning and without VTP pruning enabled.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Same as Diagram 4.2.5.1.<br><br>No VTP Pruning:<br>Animation Sequence.<br>PC1 sends out flood traffic on V LAN 10.<br><br>Switch S2 forwards the flood traffic out all of its static access ports configured on V LAN 10, as well as out the trunk link to switch S1.<br><br>Switch S1 continues to forward the flood traffic over its trunk link to S3, even though there are no static access ports configured on V LAN 10.<br><br>Switch S3 discards the flood traffic, but only after it has consumed bandwidth on the trunk link and processing time on the switch.<br><br>VTP Pruning:<br>Animation Sequence.<br>PC1 sends out flood traffic on V LAN 10. <br><br>Switch S2 forwards the flood traffic out all of its static access ports configured on V LAN 10, but does not forward the traffic out the trunk link to switch S1 because it knows that there are no other switch ports configured for V LAN 10 on any of the remote switches.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
