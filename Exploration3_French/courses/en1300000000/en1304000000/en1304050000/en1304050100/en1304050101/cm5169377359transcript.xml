<brief><content-text><![CDATA[In this chapter, you have learned: <br>- VTP simplifies V LAN administration across multiple Cisco Catalyst switches by replicating V LAN configurations between switches.<br>- A VTP domain defines which switches in a network are to be configured similarly with respect to the V LAN configuration.<br>- A Cisco Catalyst switch can be configured for one of three VTP operational modes: server, client, or transparent.<br>- VTP server mode allows for the creation, deletion, and modification of V LAN's.<br>- VTP client mode prevents modification of the V LAN's and can only receive V LAN information through VTP advertisements.<br>- VTP transparent mode allows for the creation, deletion, and modification of local V LAN's, including extended-range V LAN's. V LAN information is not synchronized with other switches.<br>- VTP passwords can be used to limit synchronization between switches configured with the same VTP domain.<br>- VTP pruning can improve the overall bandwidth over trunk links by limiting flood traffic to switches that contain active V LAN's specific for the flood traffic.<br>- Always verify your configuration to limit the possibility of VTP errors.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
