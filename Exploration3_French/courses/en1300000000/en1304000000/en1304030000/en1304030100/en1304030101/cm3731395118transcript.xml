<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a switched network with VTP enabled and includes VTP configuration guidelines.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>There are three switches, S1, S2, and S3. Switch S1 port F0/1 is connected to S2 port F0/1, and switch S1 port F0/3 is connected to S3 port F0/3. Three PC's, PC1, PC2, and PC3, are connected to switch S2 on ports F0/11, F0/18, and F0/6, respectively. Three PC's, PC4, PC5, and PC6, are connected to switch S3 on ports F0/11, F0/18, and F0/6, respectively.<br><br>PC1:<br>IP address 172.17.10.21<br>V LAN 10<br><br>PC2:<br>IP address 172.17.20.22<br>V LAN 20<br><br>PC3:<br>IP address 172.17.30.23<br>V LAN 30<br><br>PC4:<br>IP address 172.17.10.24<br>V LAN 10<br><br>PC5:<br>IP address 172.17.20.25<br>V LAN 20<br><br>PC6:<br>IP address 172.17.30.26<br>V LAN 30<br><br>VTP Configuration Guidelines.<br>On the VTP server:<br>- Confirm default settings.<br>- Configure two switches as VTP servers.<br>- Configure the VTP domain on the first switch in the network.<br>- Ensure that all switches are in the same VTP protocol version mode.<br>- Configure V LAN's and trunk ports.<br><br>On the VTP client:<br>- Confirm default settings.<br>- Configure VTP client mode.<br>- Configure trunks.<br>- Connect to the VTP server.<br>- Verify VTP status.<br>- Configure access ports.]]></content-text></brief>
