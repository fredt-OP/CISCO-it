<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts configuring the VTP server. Cisco I O S C L I commands are used to configure and verify the VTP server switch, including confirming defaults, configuring the domain name and version, and adding V LAN's and trunks.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>There are three switches, S1, S2, and S3. Switch S1 is a VTP server, and switches S2 and S3 are VTP clients. The switches are not currently connected. Three PC's, PC1, PC2, and PC3, are to be connected to switch S2 on ports F0/11, F0/18, and F0/6, respectively. Three PC's, PC4 , PC5, and PC6, are to be connected to switch S3 on ports F0/11, F0/18, and F0/6, respectively.<br><br>PC1:<br>IP address 172.17.10.21<br>V LAN 10<br><br>PC2:<br>IP address 172.17.20.22<br>V LAN 20<br><br>PC3:<br>IP address 172.17.30.23<br>V LAN 30<br><br>PC4:<br>IP address 172.17.10.24<br>V LAN 10<br><br>PC5:<br>IP address 172.17.20.25<br>V LAN 20<br><br>PC6:<br>IP address 172.17.30.26<br>V LAN 30<br><br>Confirm Defaults:<br>The highlighted areas in the following output are Configuration Revision and VTP Domain Name.<br>S1#show vtp status<br>VTP Version: 1<br>Configuration Revision: 0<br>Maximum V LAN's supported locally: 64<br>Number of existing V LAN's: 5<br>VTP Operating Mode: Server<br>VTP Domain Name:<br>VTP Pruning Mode: Disabled<br>VTP V2 Mode: Disabled<br>VTP Traps Generation: Disabled<br>MD5 digest: 0x7D 0x5A 0xA6 0x0E 0x9A 0x72 0xA0 0x3A<br>Configuration last modified by 0.0.0.0 at 3-1-93  00:41:42<br>S1#<br><br>Configure Domain Name:<br>The highlighted areas in the following output are the lines referencing the new domain name of cisco1.<br><br>S1#configure terminal<br>S1(config)#vtp domain cisco1<br>Changing VTP domain name from NULL to cisco1<br>S1(config)#exit<br><br>S1#show vtp status<br>VTP Version: 1<br>Configuration Revision: 0<br>Maximum V LAN's supported locally: 64<br>Number of existing V LAN's: 5<br>VTP Operating Mode: Server<br>VTP Domain Name: cisco1<br>output omitted<br>S1#<br><br>Configure Version:<br>Confirm that VTP version 1 is configured.<br>The highlighted area is VTP mode already in V1.<br>S1(config)#vtp version 1<br>VTP mode already in V1.<br>S1(config)#exit<br>S1#<br><br>Add V LAN's and Trunks:<br>S1#show v lan brief<br>Output omitted<br><br>V LANNameStatusPorts<br>10facultyactive<br>20studentactive<br>30guestactive<br>Output omitted<br><br>S1#show interfaces 0/1 switchport<br>Name: FA0/1<br>Switchport: Enabled<br>Administrative Mode: trunk<br>Output omitted<br><br>S1#show vtp status<br>VTP Version: 1<br>Configuration Revision: 6<br>Maximum V LAN's supported locally: 64<br>Number of existing V LAN's: 8<br>VTP Operating Mode: Server<br>VTP Domain Name: cisco1<br><br>Note: Adding a name to a V LAN is considered a revision.
