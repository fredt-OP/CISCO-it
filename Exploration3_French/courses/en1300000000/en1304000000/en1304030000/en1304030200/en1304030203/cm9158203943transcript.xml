<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts incorrect VTP domain name issues.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>There are four switches, S1, S2, S3, and S4. Switch S1 is connected to S2 and S3. Switch S3 is connected to S4. Switch S1 is a VTP server, and switches S2, S3, and S4 are VTP clients. The domain name for S1, S2, and S4 is set to cisco1. The domain name for S3 is set to Not Cisco. <br><br>Incorrect VTP Domain Name:<br>Animation Sequence.<br>A new V LAN is created on the VTP server.<br><br>The VTP server S1 sends a summary advertisement to the adjacent switches.<br><br>Switch S2 accepts the summary VTP advertisement and synchronizes its V LAN database with S1.<br><br>Switch S3 discards the VTP summary advertisement.<br><br>Switch S4 does not add V LAN 10 to its database.<br><br>VTP Domain Solution:<br>Change the VTP domain name for a VTP-enabled switch using these commands:<br>Enter global configuration mode.<br>#configure terminal<br><br>Configure the VTP domain name.<br>(config)#vtp domain domain-name<br><br>Here is an example showing how to change the VTP domain name for switch S3:<br>S3 (config)#vtp domain cisco1<br>]]></content-text></brief>
