<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts issues associated with switches set to VTP client mode and no VTP server switch is present.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>There are three switches, S1, S2, and S3. Switch S1 is connected to S2 and S3. S1 is a VTP server. S2 and S3 are VTP clients. <br><br>Switches Set to VTP Client Mode:<br>The network has been configured with these V LAN's:<br>- V LAN 10 - faculty/staff<br>- V LAN 20 - students<br>- V LAN 30 - guest<br>- V LAN 99 - management<br><br>Animation Sequence.<br>The network manager mistakenly reconfigures switch S1:<br>S1#configure terminal<br>S1(configure)#VTP mode client<br>S1(config)#end<br>S1#<br><br>If the network manager then reboots, each switch network V LAN configuration is lost. No V LAN's will be configured on any of the switches.<br><br>Solution:<br>Reset two switches in the same VTP domain to be in VTP server mode using these commands:<br>Enter global configuration mode.<br>#configure terminal<br>Configure the VTP mode.<br>(config)#vtp mode server<br><br>Here is an example showing how to change the VTP mode for switch S3 to VTP server:<br>S3#(config)#VTP mode server<br><br>]]></content-text></brief>
