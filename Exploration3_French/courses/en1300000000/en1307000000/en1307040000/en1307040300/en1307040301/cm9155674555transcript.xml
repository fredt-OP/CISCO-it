<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts solving RF interference issues from other devices. The topology is presented, followed by the reason and solution to the problem.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Three switches, S1, S2, and S3, are interconnected in a full mesh with dual trunk links. In addition:<br>Switch S1 is connected to router R1.<br>Switch S2 is connected to wired PC1 and PC2.<br>Switch S2 is connected to AP WRS2.<br>Switch S3 is connected to AP WRS3.<br>AP WRS2 is communicating with a wireless laptop.<br>AP WRS3 is communicating with a wireless laptop.<br><br>Problem: Wireless service interruption. The microwave oven and cordless phone are not in the E S S. They hog the 2.4 Gigahertz channels rather than contend for them. <br><br>Reason: Sources of RF interference can be found all around the workplace or in the home. The diagram shows how these devices operate on various channels in the 2.4 Gigahertz band and can interfere with wireless AP channels.<br><br>Solution: Perform a site survey using one of the following options:<br> - Use dedicated and sophisticated site survey tools, such as Airmagnet, to check a facility floorplan and record the RF characteristics. The findings are then shown on the floorplan as you move about the facility with your wireless laptop. An example of an Airmagnet site survey is shown in screenshot 2 in the diagram.<br><br> - If dedicated site survey tools are not available, mount AP's on tripods and set them in locations based on the projected site plan. Walk around the facility using a site survey meter in the W LAN client utility of your PC (shown in screenshot 1 in the diagram).<br>]]></content-text></brief>
