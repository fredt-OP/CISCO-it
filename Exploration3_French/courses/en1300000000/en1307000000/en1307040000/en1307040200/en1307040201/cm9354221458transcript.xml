<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts resolving issues of incorrect channel settings for a wireless AP. The topology is presented, followed by the reason and solution to the problem.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Three switches, S1, S2, and S3, are interconnected in a full mesh with dual trunk links. In addition:<br>Switch S1 is connected to router R1.<br>Switch S2 is connected to wired PC1 and PC2.<br>Switch S2 is connected to AP WRS2.<br>Switch S3 is connected to AP WRS3.<br>AP WRS2 is communicating with a wireless laptop and using channel two.<br>AP WRS3 is communicating with a wireless laptop and using channel one.<br><br>Problem: Users report connectivity issues in the area between access points in an extended service set W LAN.<br><br>Reason: There could be a channel setting issue. The diagram shows that channels one and two are in the 2.4 Gigahertz band, are adjacent, and have a 12-Megahertz overlap.<br><br>Solution: Reset the AP's to non-overlapping channels. In the example shown, the Linksys G U I interface is used to set AP WRS2 to channel six, which results in no overlap with AP WRS3 on channel one.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
