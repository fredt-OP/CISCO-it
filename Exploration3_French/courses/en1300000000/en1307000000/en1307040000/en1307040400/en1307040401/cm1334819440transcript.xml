<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts problems with access point misplacement. The topology is presented, followed by the reason and solution to the problem.<br><br>Problem: Wireless clients keep losing association with an access point, or data rates are much slower than they should be. <br><br>Reason: Part one of the diagram shows a wireless client in a location between AP's that are too far apart. The client cannot associate with either WRS2 or WRS3. The distance separating the access points is too far to allow overlapping coverage.<br><br>Part two of the diagram shows a wireless client in a location where it cannot associate with an AP because of the orientation of the access point antennae in the hallways and corners, which diminishes coverage.<br><br>Solution: <br>Part one:<br>Confirm the power settings and operational ranges of the AP's, and place them for a minimum of 10 to 15 percent cell overlap.<br><br>Part Two: <br>Change the orientation and positioning of the access points to improve coverage.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
