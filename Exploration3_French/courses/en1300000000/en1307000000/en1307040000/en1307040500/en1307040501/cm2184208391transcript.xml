<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts problems with W LAN authentication and encryption. The topology is presented, following by the reason and solution to the problem.<br><br>Problem: The wireless client attempts to connect to an AP, and the connections fails. <br><br>Reason: If the access point is expecting one type of encryption, and the client offers a different type, the authentication process fails. This can be due to the wrong encryption type set on the client or wrong credentials supplied. For example, the access point might expect 32 characters in the key from the client.<br><br>Solution: Using the client wireless utility, set the encryption type to match that of the AP, and set the credential supplied by the client to match those expected by the AP. For example, the client matches its key to 32 characters that is expected by the access point. The access point expects 32 characters in the key. The result is successful authentication.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
