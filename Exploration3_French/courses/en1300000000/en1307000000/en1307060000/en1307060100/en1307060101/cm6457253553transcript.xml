<brief><content-text><![CDATA[In this chapter, you have learned the following: <br>- Evolving standards, including 8 0 2 dot 11a, b, g, and now draft n, allow powerful applications, such as voice, to be deployed as mobility services over wireless LAN's.<br>- A single access point connected to the wired LAN provides a basic service set to client stations that associate to it. Multiple access points that share an SSID combine to form an extended service set.<br>- Wireless LAN's can be detected by any radio-enabled client device, and therefore potentially allow access to attackers that may not have had access to a wired-only network.<br>- Methods such as MAC address filtering and SSID masking can be part of a security best practice, but these methods alone are easily overcome by a determined attacker. PSK2 Enterprise with 8 0 2 dot 1x authentication should be the minimum security used in an enterprise wireless LAN.<br>- Both access points and wireless NIC's must be configured with similar parameters, such as the SSID, before association is possible.<br>- When you configure a wireless LAN, ensure that the devices have the latest firmware so that they can all be configured correctly and with the latest available settings, for instance, PSK2 Enterprise.<br>- If wireless devices are disconnecting from the wireless LAN, check channel settings and for interference from common devices, such as microwave ovens and cordless phones.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
