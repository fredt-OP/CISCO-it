<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the process of planning a wireless LAN. The process starts with a map of a building floorplan, with a scale from zero to one hundred feet. Additional information is provided on the coverage area, the alignment of the coverage areas, and arrangement of AP's on the plan map.<br><br>Coverage Area:<br>The diagram shows a square representing one of the four coverage areas in the building and the calculation of the radius (R) for determining the size of the circular coverage area for the square footage involved. The length of one side of the square is Z.<br><br>The requirements specify that coverage area A equals 5000 square feet.<br>Where A = Z squared, find R.<br><br>From Pythagoras:<br>2 times R squared = Z squared.<br><br>R= the square root of Z squared, divided by 2.<br>R= the square root of 5000 square feet, divided by 2.<br>R= the square root of 2500 square feet.<br>R= 50 feet, and Z = 70.71 feet.<br><br>Alignment of Coverage Area:<br>The diagram shows aligning two of the four coverage areas in the building along the length of the square side (Z) to ensure minimum BSA overlap of the coverage circles.<br><br>Arrangement on the Plan Map:<br>The diagram shows four 50-foot radius coverage circles arranged on the floorplan so that they overlap. The center of each circle is the location of the AP for that coverage area. <br>]]></content-text></brief>
