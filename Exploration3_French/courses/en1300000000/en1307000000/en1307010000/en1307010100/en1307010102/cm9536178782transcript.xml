<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram compares various wireless technologies. Four nested ovals are shown with each one larger than the previous one. From smallest to largest, they show a personal area network (PAN), local area network (LAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), and wide area network (WAN). A wireless LAN topology is also shown.<br><br>Information is provided on each of these wireless network types.<br><br>Wireless Technologies:<br>Personal Area Network (PAN)<br>Standards: Bluetooth, 8 0 2 dot 15.3.<br>Speed: less than 1 Megabit per second.<br>Range: Short.<br>Applications: Peer-to-Peer, Device-to-Device.<br><br>Local Area Network (LAN)<br>Standards: 8 0 2 dot 11.<br>Speed: 11 to 54 Megabit per second.<br>Range: Medium.<br>Applications: Enterprise Networks.<br><br>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)<br>Standards: 8 0 2 dot 11, 8 0 2 dot 16, and 8 0 2 dot 20.<br>Speed: 10 to 100 plus Megabit per second.<br>Range: Medium-Long.<br>Applications: Last Mile Access.<br><br>Wide Area Network (WAN)<br>Standards: GSM, CDMA, Satellite.<br>Speed: 10 Kilobits per second to 2 Megabits per second.<br>Range: Long.<br>Applications: Mobile Data Devices.<br><br>Wireless LAN's:<br>Network Topology:<br>Three switches, S1, S2, and S3, are interconnected in a full mesh using dual trunk links between switches. Switch S1 is connected to router R1 using a single link and one router interface. Wireless access points and wireless PC's are connected to the main LAN as an extension of it. Device connections are as follows:<br>- Switch S1 port F0/1 is connected to S2 port F0/1 (Trunk).<br>- Switch S1 port F0/2 is connected to S2 port F0/2 (Trunk).<br>- Switch S1 port F0/5 is connected to R1 port F0/1.<br>- Switch S2 port F0/3 is connected to S3 port F0/1 (Trunk).<br>- Switch S2 port F0/4 is connected to S3 port F0/2 (Trunk).<br>- Switch S2 port F0/11 is connected to PC1 with IP address 172.17.10.21. <br>- Switch S2 port F0/18 is connected to PC2 with IP address 172.17.20.22. <br>- Switch S2 port F0/7 is connected to wireless router WRS2. The WRS2 IP address is 172.17.99.25 /24. PC3, with IP address 172.17.99.23, is connected to WRS2 via wireless.<br>- Switch S3 port F0/4 is connected to S1 port F0/4 (Trunk).<br>- Switch S3 port F0/3 is connected to S1 port F0/3 (Trunk).<br>- Switch S3 port F0/7 is connected to wireless router WRS3. The WRS3 IP address is 172.17.99.35 /24. PC6 is connected to WRS3 via wireless.<br>- Web/FTP Server is connected to R1 port F0/0. The R1 F0/0 IP address is 172.17.50.1. The Web/FTP Server IP address is 172.17.50.254.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
