<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a wireless network infrastructure with four wireless access points (AP's), AP1, AP2, AP3, and AP4, at various locations on a building floorplan. Each AP has a circle around it representing the range or coverage area for station access. These circles overlap with one another.<br><br>Hidden node problem:<br>The diagram also depicts the hidden node problem, which can occur when two client stations that are connected to the same AP are at the maximum range. Neither station senses the other on the medium, and they may end up transmitting simultaneously. Wireless LAN's use Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) to avoid the hidden node problem.<br><br>In the topology shown, wireless AP WRS3 has three wireless laptops, PC1, PC2, and PC3, communicating with it. <br><br>The hidden node problem:<br>- PC1 and PC2 reach WRS3.<br>- PC1 and PC2 cannot reach each other.<br>- PC1 does not detect PC2 activity on the channel.<br>- PC1 sends data while PC2 is transmitting.<br>- A collision occurs.<br><br>PC3 is sensed by both PC1 and PC2, so there are no collisions involving PC3.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
