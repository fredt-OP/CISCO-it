<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts various wireless 8 0 2 dot 11 topologies. These include ad hoc, basic service sets (BSS), and extended service sets (E S S).<br><br>Ad Hoc:<br>The topology shows two PC's communicating directly via wireless and no AP.<br>The tabular information provided is as follows:<br>AP's: None.<br>Topology: Independent BSS (I BSS).<br>Connection: Peer-to-Peer.<br>Mode: Ad hoc.<br>Coverage: Basic Service Area (BSA).<br><br>Basic Service Sets (BSS):<br>The topology shows two PC's communicating via wireless through an AP (labeled WRS for wireless router switch). The AP is connected to switch S2. S2 has two PC's attached and has a redundant connection to switch S1. Switch S1 is connected to router R1.<br>The tabular information provided is as follows:<br>AP's: One.<br>Topology: BSS.<br>Connection: Client to AP.<br>Mode: Infrastructure.<br>Coverage: BSA.<br><br>Extended Service Sets (E S S):<br>The topology builds on the BSS topology with an additional switch, S3. A second AP is connected to S3, and a wireless laptop is communicating with the AP. <br>The tabular information provided is as follows:<br>AP's: More than one.<br>Topology: E S S.<br>Connection: Client to AP.<br>Mode: Infrastructure.<br>Coverage: Extended Service Area (ESA).<br><br>Summary:<br>The tabular information provided is as follows:<br>Wireless Devices: No access points.<br>Topology Mode: Ad hoc.<br>Topology Building Block: I BSS.<br>Coverage Area: BSA.<br><br>Wireless Devices: One access point.<br>Topology Mode: Infrastructure.<br>Topology Building Block: BSS.<br>Coverage Area: BSA.<br><br>Wireless Devices: Multiple access points.<br>Topology Mode: Infrastructure.<br>Topology Building Block: E S S.<br>Coverage Area: ESA.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
