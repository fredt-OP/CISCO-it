<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the graphical user interface (G U I) of a Linksys wireless router with wireless router setup parameters. These include Wireless Network Mode, Service Set Identifier (SSID), and Channel.<br><br>Parameters settings:<br>The Linksys G U I screenshot shows:<br>Wireless Network Mode: Mixed.<br>Wireless Network Name (SSID): linksys 03.<br>Wireless Channel: 1 - 2.412 Gigahertz.<br>Wireless SSID Broadcast: Enabled.<br><br>Mode: <br>In the topology shown, wireless router WRS2 has three wireless laptop clients communicating with it. One of the clients is 8 0 2 dot 11b, and the other two are 8 0 2 dot 11g. The WR supports both 8 0 2 dot 11b and g. A text bubble for the 8 0 2 dot 11b client states: 8 0 2 dot 11b client forces faster clients who are contending for the channel to wait longer.<br><br>SSID:<br>The G U I screenshot shows a wireless client network connection screen from which the user can select one of three different wireless network AP's that are in range based on the SSID. SSID's are linksys 03, linksys 03, and linksys.<br><br>Channel:<br>The diagram depicts the 2.4 Gigahertz Radio Frequency (RF) band. All channels are 22 Megahertz in bandwidth, with 5 Megahertz separation between channels. Channel One, Channel Six, and Channel Eleven frequency ranges do not overlap. The curvature of each frequency range indicates that the highest RF energy is at the center point of each channel and that it dissipates toward the edges of the channel.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
