<brief><content-text><![CDATA[In this chapter, you have learned: <br>- Inter-V LAN routing is accomplished using a dedicated router or a multilayer switch. Inter-V LAN routing facilitates communication between devices isolated by V LAN boundaries.<br>- Traditional inter-V LAN routing requires that a router be configured with multiple physical interfaces, each connected physically to separate V LAN's on a switch.<br>- The router-on-a-stick model provides similar functionality to the traditional inter-V LAN routing at reduced cost but provides lower performance on busy networks.<br>- Traditional inter-V LAN routing uses the physical interfaces of the router, while router-on-a-stick inter-V LAN routing uses logical subinterfaces of the physical interface.<br>- It is important to configure switch ports connected to the router for the appropriate V LAN's. Configure each router interface with the subnet associated with each V LAN.<br>- It is important to configure each subinterface on a router-on-a-stick with a unique V LAN ID and corresponding IP address to match the subnet associated with the V LAN.<br>- To reduce the risk of switch, router, or IP address configuration problems, verify the configuration of each device.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
