<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts router-on-a-stick inter-V LAN routing, which uses a single router interface.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Same as 6.1.1 Diagram 2, except that there is only a single trunk link from switch S1 port F0/5 to router R1 interface F0/1. This single physical router interface has three logical subinterfaces defined: <br>Subinterface F0/0 dot 10, IP address 172.17.10.1<br>Subinterface F0/0 dot 20, IP address 172.17.20.1<br>Subinterface F0/0 dot 30, IP address 172.17.30.1<br><br>Scenario:<br>PC1 (in V LAN 10) sends a unicast frame to PC3 (in V LAN 30) via switches S2 and S1 and router R1, using a single router interface.<br><br>Animation sequence:<br>One. PC1 sends its unicast traffic to switch S2.<br><br>Two. Switch S2 tags the unicast traffic as originating on V LAN 10, and then forwards the unicast traffic out its trunk link to switch S1.<br><br>Three. Switch S1 forwards the tagged traffic out the other trunk interface on port F0/5 to the interface on router R1.<br><br>Four. Router R1 accepts the tagged unicast traffic on V LAN 10 and routes it to V LAN 30 using its configured subinterfaces.<br><br>Five. The unicast traffic is tagged with V LAN 30 as it is sent out the router interface to switch S1.<br><br>Six. Switch S1 forwards the tagged unicast traffic out the other trunk link to switch S2.<br><br>Seven. Switch S2 removes the V LAN tag of the unicast frame and forwards the frame out to PC3 on port F0/6.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
