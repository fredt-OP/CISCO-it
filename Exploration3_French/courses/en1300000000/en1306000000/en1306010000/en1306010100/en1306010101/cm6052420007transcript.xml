<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the concept of inter-V LAN routing using a separate router connected to the switch infrastructure.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Switch S2 has two PC's. PC1 is connected to port F0/11. PC 3 is connected to port F0/6. The PC1 IP address is 172.17.10.21, and the PC3 IP address is 172.17.30.23. PC1 is in V LAN 10, and PC3 is in V LAN 30.<br><br>Switch S2 is connected to router R1 using two links and two router interfaces. Switch S2 port F0/1 is connected to router R1 interface F0/0. Switch S2 port F0/2 is connected to Router R1 interface F0/1. This allows the router to route between V LAN 10 and V LAN 30.<br><br>Caption text: Router-based inter-V LAN routing is a process for forwarding network traffic from one V LAN to another V LAN using a router.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
