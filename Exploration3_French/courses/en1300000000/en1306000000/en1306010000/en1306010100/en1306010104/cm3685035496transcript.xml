<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts switch-based inter-V LAN routing, which uses a Layer 3 switch to perform the routing function. <br><br>Network Topology:<br>Same as 6.1.1 Diagram 2, except that there is no router present. Switch S1 has three logical V LAN interfaces defined to perform inter-V LAN routing:<br>Interface V LAN 10, IP address 172.17.10.1<br>Interface V LAN 20, IP address 172.17.20.1<br>Interface V LAN 30, IP address 172.17.30.1<br><br>Scenario:<br>PC1 on V LAN 10 is communicating with PC3 on V LAN 30 through switch S1 using V LAN interfaces configured for each V LAN.<br><br>Animation sequence:<br>One. PC1 sends its unicast traffic to switch S2.<br><br>Two. Switch S2 tags the unicast traffic as originating on V LAN 10. It then forwards the unicast traffic out its trunk link to switch S1.<br><br>Three. Switch S1 removes the V LAN tag and forwards the unicast traffic to the V LAN 10 interface.<br><br>Four. Switch S1 routes the unicast traffic to its V LAN 30 interface.<br><br>Five. Switch S1 then retags the unicast traffic with V LAN 30 and forwards it out the trunk link back to switch S2.<br><br>Six. Switch S2 removes the V LAN tag of the unicast frame and forwards the frame out to PC3 on port F0/6.<br><br>Seven. The process is then reversed. PC3 in V LAN 30 sends a packet back to PC1 in V LAN 10.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
