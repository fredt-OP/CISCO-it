<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts more detailed information on how traditional inter-V LAN routing is accomplished using two router interfaces. <br><br>Network Topology:<br>Three switches, S1, S2 and S 3, are interconnected in a full mesh using dual trunk links between switches. Switch S1 is connected to router R1 using two links and two router interfaces. Device connections are as follows:<br>- Switch S1 Port F0/1 is connected to S2 Port F0/1 (Trunk).<br>- Switch S1 Port F0/2 is connected to S2 Port F0/2 (Trunk).<br>- Switch S1 Port F0/5 (V LAN 30) is connected to R1 Port F0/1.<br>- Switch S1 Port F0/6 (V LAN 10) is connected to R1 Port F0/0.<br>- Switch S2 Port F0/3 is connected to S 3 Port F0/1 (Trunk).<br>- Switch S2 Port F0/4 is connected to S 3 Port F0/2 (Trunk).<br>- Switch S2 Port F0/11 is connected to PC1 with IP address 172.17.10.21 (V LAN 10). <br>- Switch S2 Port F0/18 is connected to PC2 with IP address 172.17.20.22 (V LAN 20). <br>- Switch S2 Port F0/6 is connected to PC3 with IP address 172.17.30.23 (V LAN 20). <br>- Switch S 3 Port F0/4 is connected to S1 Port F0/4 (Trunk).<br>- Switch S 3 Port F0/3 is connected to S1 Port F0/3 (Trunk).<br><br>Scenario:<br>PC1 (in V LAN 10) sends a unicast frame to PC3 (in V LAN 30) via switches S2 and S1 and router R1, using two router interfaces.<br><br>Animation sequence:<br>One. PC1 sends out an ARP request broadcast on V LAN 10 to determine its gateway MAC address. The gateway for PC1 is the nearest interface of the router.<br><br>Two. The ARP request broadcast is forwarded by switch S2 out all ports assigned to V LAN 10 and the trunk link connected to switch S1.<br><br>Three. The ARP request broadcast frame is tagged with V LAN 10 as it traverses the trunk link between switches S2 and S1.<br><br>Four. Switch S1 removes the V LAN tag and forwards the frame out the ports configured for V LAN 10, including port F0/6, which is connected to router R1.<br><br>Five. Router R1 sends an ARP reply with the physical MAC address of the F0/0 interface back to PC1.<br><br>Six. PC1 frames the data and forwards it as unicast traffic to router R1 over switches S2 and S1. After router R1 accepts the frame, it removes the original source and destination MAC addresses and examines the destination IP address to determine where to forward the packet.<br><br>Seven. Router R1 compares the address with the routes configured in its local routing table. R1 identifies that the destination network is locally connected to interface F0/1, so it proceeds to send out an ARP request for PC3 on V LAN 30.<br><br>Eight. The ARP request broadcast traverses switches S1 and S2, going out all ports configured for V LAN 30, where it reaches PC3.<br><br>Nine. PC3 then sends an ARP reply back to R1 with its local MAC address.<br><br>Ten. When router R1 receives the ARP reply, the router frames the packet with the new source and destination MAC addresses and forwards the frame to the local V LAN, which is V LAN 30.<br><br>Eleven. Switch S1 forwards the frame to switch S2, where it is sent out port F0/6 to PC3.<br><br>Twelve. PC3 needs to respond to PC1 to confirm the receipt of the data sent from PC1. Because PC3 already has the MAC address of the router R1 F0/1 interface from the previous ARP request that the router sent, it does not need to resend an ARP request before it can frame the packet it is sending to PC1.<br><br>Thirteen. PC3 sends the framed packet destined for PC1 to router R1 with the destination MAC address of the F0/1 interface of R1 on V LAN 30.<br><br>Fourteen. Router R1 receives the frame and removes the original source and destination MAC addresses to examine the destination IP address (the IP address of PC1) to determine where to forward the packet.<br><br>Fifteen. Router R1 determines that the local F0/0 interface is connected to the correct subnet and that it should use that physical interface to send the packet back to PC1.<br><br>Sixteen. Router R1 frames the packet with the destination MAC address of PC1, which it still remembers from the original ARP exchange between PC1 and router R1. R1 then forwards the frame to switch S1. S1 then forwards it to switch S2, where the frame is finally delivered back to PC1.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
