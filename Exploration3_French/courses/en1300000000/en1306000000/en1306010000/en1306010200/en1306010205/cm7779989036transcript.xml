<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram compares the difference between using multiple physical interfaces and a single physical interface that has subinterfaces for inter-V LAN routing.<br><br>Physical Interface: One physical interface per V LAN.<br>Subinterface: One physical interface for many V LAN's.<br><br>Physical Interface: No bandwidth contention.<br>Subinterface: Bandwidth contention.<br><br>Physical Interface: Connected to access mode switch port.<br>Subinterface: Connected to trunk mode switch port.<br><br>Physical Interface: More expensive.<br>Subinterface: Less expensive.<br><br>Physical Interface: More complex connection configuration.<br>Subinterface: Less complex connection configuration.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
