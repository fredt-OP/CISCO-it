<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts router configuration issues. <br><br>Topology One:<br>Switch S1 has two PC's. PC1 is connected to Port F0/11, and PC3 is connected to F0/6. The PC1 IP address is 172.17.10.21. The PC3 IP address is 172.17.30.23. PC1 is in V LAN 10, and PC3 is in V LAN 30.<br><br>Switch S1 is connected to router R1 using two links and two router interfaces. Switch S1 port F0/4 is connected to router R1 interface F0/0 with IP address 172.17.10.1 /24. Switch S1 port F0/5 is connected to router R1 interface F0/1 with IP address 172.17.30.1 /24. This allows the router to route between V LAN 10 and V LAN 30. Switch S1 ports F0/4 and F0/11 are in V LAN 10. Switch S1 ports F0/5 and F0/6 are in V LAN 30. Switch S1 port F0/9 is in the default V LAN.<br><br>Topology One illustrates an issue with traditional inter-V LAN routing. Router interface F0/0 is connected to the wrong switch port. Switch port F0/9 is in default V LAN 1. The R1 router interface F0/0 should be connected to switch port F0/4, which is in V LAN 10, for PC1 to communicate with the router R1 interface F0/0 and allow routing to occur.<br><br>Topology Two:<br>Same as Topology One, except that there is only one link from switch S1 F0/5 to router R1 interface F0/0. The single router physical interface F0/0 has two logical subinterfaces defined: <br>Subinterface F0/0 dot 10, IP address 172.17.10.1 /24, encapsulation dot 1Q 1<br>Subinterface F0/0 dot 30, IP address 172.17.30.1 /24, encapsulation dot 1Q 30<br><br>Topology Two illustrates an issue with router-on-a-stick routing. Subinterface F0/0 dot 10 has been configured to use the wrong V LAN, preventing devices configured on V LAN 10 from communicating with subinterface F0/0.10. The encapsulation on subinterface F0/0 dot 10 should be dot 1Q 10.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
