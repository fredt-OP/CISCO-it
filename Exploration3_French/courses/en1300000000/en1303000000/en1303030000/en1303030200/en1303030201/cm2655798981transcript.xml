An example and verification are also provided.<br><br>Command syntax:<br>Switch from privileged EXEC mode to global configuration mode.<br>Command: S1#configure terminal<br><br>Create a V LAN where v lan id is the V LAN number that is to be created. Switch to V LAN configuration mode for V LAN v lan id.<br>Command: S1(config)#v lan v lan id<br><br>(Optional) Specify a unique V LAN name to identify the V LAN.<br>If no name is entered, the V LAN number, with padded zeros, is appended to the word V LAN, for example, V LAN0020.<br>Command: S1(config-v lan)#name v lan name<br><br>Return to privileged EXEC mode. You must end your configuration session for the configuration to be saved in the v lan dot dat file and for the configuration to take effect.<br>Command: S1(config-v lan)#end<br><br>Example:<br>PC2 is connected to switch S1, and S1 is connected to S2. Switch S1 is configured with V LAN 20 and named student. The configuration commands to configure S1 are as follows:<br><br>S1#configure terminal<br>S1(config)#v lan 20<br>S1(config-v lan)#name student<br>S1(config-v lan)#end<br><br>Verification:<br>The output from the show v lan brief command shows the following. <br>V LAN: 20<br>Name: student<br>Status: active<br>Ports: Currently no ports in this V LAN<br>]]></content-text></brief>
