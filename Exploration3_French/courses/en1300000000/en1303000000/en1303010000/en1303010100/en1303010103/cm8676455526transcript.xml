<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a multi-switch environment (three switches) with three V LAN's spread across the three switches.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>There are three switches, S1, S2, and S3. Switch S2 port F0/1 is connected to S1 port F0/1 using a crossover cable. Switch S3 port F0/3 is connected to S1 port F0/3 using a crossover cable. Router R1 interface F0/1 is connected to Switch S1 port F0/5 using a straight-through cable.<br><br>There are six PC's in total. PC1, PC2, and PC3 connect to switch S2 using ports F0/11, F0/18, and F0/6, respectively, with straight-through cables. PC4, PC5, and PC6 are connected to switch S3 using ports F0/11, F0/18 and F0/6 respectively, with straight-through cables.<br><br>PC1: <br>Faculty V LAN 10.<br>172.17.10.21 /24.<br><br>PC4:<br>Faculty V LAN 10.<br>172.17.10.24 /24.<br><br>PC2:<br>Student V LAN 20.<br>172.17.20.22 /24.<br><br>PC5:<br>Student V LAN 20.<br>172.17.20.25 /24.<br><br>PC3:<br>Guest V LAN 30.<br>172.17.30.23 /24.<br><br>PC6:<br>Guest V LAN 30.<br>172.17.30.26 /24.<br><br>Benefits of V LAN's include:<br>- Security.<br>- Cost reduction.<br>- Higher performance.<br>- Broadcast storm mitigation.<br>- Improved I T staff efficiency.<br>- Simpler project and application management.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
