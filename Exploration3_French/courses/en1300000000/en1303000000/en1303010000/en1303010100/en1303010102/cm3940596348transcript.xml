<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts an overview and give details of what a V LAN is. <br><br>Overview<br>One standalone building contains two V LAN's, one for the students and one for the faculty.<br>- A V LAN is an independent LAN network.<br>- A V LAN allows student and faculty PC's to be separated although they share the same infrastructure.<br>- A V LAN can be named for easier identification.<br><br>Details<br>Three PC's, PC1, PC2 and PC3, are connected to switch S2. PC1, with IP address 172.17.30.21, is connected to switch port F0/11. PC2, with IP address 172.17.30.22, is connected to switch port F0/18, and PC3, with IP address 172.17.30.23, is connected to switch port F0/6. <br><br>All PC's have IP addresses in the subnet defined for V LAN 30. V LAN 30 addresses consist of 172.17.30.0 /24. All switch ports are in V LAN 30.<br>- A V LAN equals a subnet (in modern switched LAN's).<br>- On the switch:<br>Configure the V LAN.<br>Assign the port to the V LAN.<br>- On the PC, assign an IP address in the V LAN subnet.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
