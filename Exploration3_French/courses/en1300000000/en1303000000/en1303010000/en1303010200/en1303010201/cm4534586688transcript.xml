<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts four types of V LAN's: data, default, native, and management. <br><br>Network Topology:<br>There are three switches, S1, S2, and S3. Switch S2 port F0/1 is connected to S1 port F0/1 using a crossover cable. Switch S3 port F0/3 is connected to S1 port F0/3 using a crossover cable. Router R1 interface F0/1 is connected to switch S1 port F0/5 using a straight-through cable.<br><br>There are five PC's in total. PC0 connects to switch S1 using port F0/4. PC2 and PC3 connect to switch S2 using ports F0/18 and F0/6, respectively. PC5 and PC6 are connected to switch S3 using ports F0/18 and F0/6, respectively.<br><br>PC0: <br>Management PC<br>V LAN 99<br>172.17.99.10 /24<br><br>PC2:<br>Student V LAN 20<br>172.17.20.22 /24<br><br>PC5:<br>Student V LAN 20<br>172.17.20.25 /24<br><br>PC3:<br>Guest V LAN 30<br>172.17.30.23 /24<br><br>PC6:<br>Guest V LAN 30<br>172.17.30.26 /24<br><br>Switches S1, S2, and S3:<br>F0/1 and F0/3 are 8 0 2 dot 1Q trunk interfaces with native V LAN 99-172.17.99.0 /24<br><br>Data V LAN:<br>Cables are highlighted from PC2 and PC3 to switch S2, and from PC5 and PC5 to switch S3.<br><br>Default V LAN:<br>The ports interconnecting switches S1, S2, and S3 are highlighted. These include switch S1 port F0/1 and F0/3, switch S2 port F0/1, and switch S3 port F0/3.<br><br>Native V LAN:<br>Cables are highlighted between switches S1 and S2, between S3 and S2, and between S1 and router R1.<br><br>Management V LAN:<br>Cables are highlighted between switches S1 and S2 and between S3 and S1. The cable between switch S1 and PC0 is also highlighted.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
