<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts the V LAN trunking operation.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>There are three switches, S1, S2, and S3. Switch S2 port F0/1 is connected to S1 port F0/1 using a crossover cable. Switch S3 port F0/3 is connected to S1 port F0/3 using a crossover cable. <br><br>There are six PC's in total. PC1, PC2, and PC3 connect to switch S2 through ports F0/11, F0/18 and F0/6, respectively, using straight-through cables. PC4, PC5, and PC6 are connected to switch S3 through ports F0/11, F0/18, and F0/6, respectively, using straight-through cables.<br><br>An arrow points to the links between S1 and S2 and between S1 and S3 with the text: V LAN trunks configured to support V LANs 10, 20, and 30.<br><br>PC1:<br>Faculty V LAN 10<br>172.17.10.21<br><br>PC4:<br>Faculty V LAN 10<br>172.17.10.24<br><br>PC2:<br>Student V LAN 20<br>172.17.20.22<br><br>PC5:<br>Student V LAN 20<br>172.17.20.25<br><br>PC3:<br>Guest V LAN 30<br>172.17.30.23<br><br>PC6:<br>Guest V LAN 30<br>172.17.30.25<br><br>Step One: PC1 and PC3 scenario text:<br>PC1 sends out a broadcast on V LAN 10.<br>PC3 sends out a broadcast on V LAN 30.<br><br>Step Two: Switch S2 tags each frame with the correct V LAN ID.<br>Tagged Frame (from PC1): V ID=10. <br>Tagged Frame (from PC3): V ID=30. <br><br>Step Three: The S2 and S1 switches send the tagged frames out all ports configured for V LAN's 10 and 30.<br><br>Step Four: S3 receives the tagged frames, strips the tags from the frames, and routes the untagged frames out the correct ports: port F0/11 for V LAN 10 to PC4, and port F0/6 for V LAN 30 to PC6.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
