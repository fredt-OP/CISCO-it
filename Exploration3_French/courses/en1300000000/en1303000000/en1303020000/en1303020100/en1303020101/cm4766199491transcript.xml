<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the concept of a V LAN Trunk Link. <br><br>Network Topology:<br>There are three switches, S1, S2, and S3. Switch S2 port F0/1 is connected to S1 port F0/1 using a crossover cable. Switch S3 port F0/3 is connected to S1 port F0/3 using a crossover cable. <br><br>There are six PC's in total. PC1, PC2, and PC3 connect to switch S2 through ports F0/11, F0/18 and F0/6, respectively, using straight-through cables. PC4, PC5, and PC6 are connected to switch S3 through ports F0/11, F0/18 and F0/6, respectively, using straight-through cables.<br><br>V LAN definitions:<br>V LAN 10 Faculty/Staff - 172.17.10.0 /24<br>V LAN 20 Students - 172.17.20.0 /24<br>V LAN 30 Guest - 172.17.30.0 /24<br>V LAN 99 Management and Native - 172.17.99.0 /24<br><br>Ports:<br>F0/1 to F0/5 are 8 0 2 dot 1Q trunk interfaces with native V LAN 99<br>F0/11 to F0/17 are in V LAN 10<br>F0/18 to F0/24 are in V LAN 20<br>F0/6 to F0/10 are in V LAN 30<br><br>PC1:<br>Faculty V LAN 10<br>172.17.10.21<br><br>PC4:<br>Faculty V LAN 10<br>172.17.10.24<br><br>PC2:<br>Student V LAN 20<br>172.17.20.22<br><br>PC5:<br>Student V LAN 20<br>172.17.20.25<br><br>PC3:<br>Guest V LAN 30<br>172.17.30.23<br><br>PC6:<br>Guest V LAN 30<br>172.17.30.26<br><br>An arrow points to the links between S1 and S2 and between S1 and S3 with the text: V LAN trunks configured to support V LANs 10, 20, and 30 and V LAN 99.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
