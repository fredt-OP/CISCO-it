<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts using a V LAN trunk link to consolidate and reduce the number of switch ports used. <br><br>Without V LAN Trunks:<br>There are two switches, S1 and S2. S2 is connected to S1 using four crossover cables and four ports on each switch. <br><br>There are three PC's, PC1, PC2, and PC3, which are connected to switch S2 using straight-through cables.<br><br>V LAN definitions:<br>Faculty - 172.17.10.0 /24<br>Students - 172.17.20.0 /24<br>Guest - 172.17.30.0 /24<br>Management and Native - 172.17.99.0 /24<br><br>PC1:<br>Faculty V LAN 10<br>172.17.10.21<br><br>PC2:<br>Student V LAN 20<br>172.17.20.22<br><br>PC3:<br>Guest V LAN 20<br>172.17.30.23<br><br>An oval surrounds the four links between the switches with the text:<br>Four switch ports, one for each subnetwork.<br><br>With V LAN Trunks:<br>The diagram is same as the previous one but the four separate interconnecting switch links are merged into one trunk link.<br><br>V LAN definitions:<br>V LAN 10-Faculty - 172.17.10.0 /24<br>V LAN 20-Students - 172.17.20.0 /24<br>V LAN 30-Guest - 172.17.30.0 /24<br>V LAN 99-Management and Native - 172.17.99.0 /24<br><br>PC1: <br>Faculty V LAN 10<br>172.17.10.21<br><br>PC2:<br>Student V LAN 20<br>172.17.20.22<br><br>PC3:<br>Guest V LAN 30<br>172.17.30.23<br><br>An oval surrounds the single link between the switches with the text:<br>One switch port and four V LAN's: 10, 20, 30, and 99 subnetworks.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
