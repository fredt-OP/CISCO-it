<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) mode interactions, including initial port configuration, determining which link to configure as a trunk, and DTP modes.<br><br>Initial Port Configuration:<br>Network Topology:<br>There are three switches, S1, S2, and S3. Switch S2 port F0/1 is connected to S1 port F0/1 using a crossover cable. Switch S3 port F0/3 is connected to S1 port F0/3 using a crossover cable. <br><br>Switch S1 port F0/1 is configured with the command switchport mode trunk.<br><br>Switch S2 port F0/1 is configured with the command switchport mode trunk.<br><br>Switch S1 port F0/3 is configured with the command switchport mode dynamic auto.<br><br>Switch S3 port F0/3 is configured with the command switchport mode dynamic auto.<br><br>Determining which link is configured as a trunk:<br>Switch S1 links to S2. This link is a trunk.<br>Configuring both ports with switchport mode trunk effectively forces them to stay in trunk mode.<br><br>Switch S1 links to S3. This link is not a trunk.<br>Configuring both ports with switchport mode dynamic auto results in an inactive trunk link.<br><br>DTP Mode and Switch Port Mode Interactions Table:<br>Note: The table assumes that DTP is enabled at both ends. The command show dtp interfaces is used to determine the current settings.<br><br>S1 Port F0/1 set to: Dynamic Auto.<br>S2 Port F0/1 set to: Dynamic Auto.<br>S1 to S2 DTP Link mode: Access.<br><br>S1 Port F0/1 set to: Dynamic Auto.<br>S2 Port F0/1 set to: Dynamic Desirable.<br>S1 to S2 DTP Link mode: Trunk.<br><br>S1 Port F0/1 set to: Dynamic Auto.<br>S2 Port F0/1 set to: Trunk.<br>S1 to S2 DTP Link mode: Trunk.<br><br>S1 Port F0/1 set to: Dynamic Auto.<br>S2 Port F0/1 set to: Access.<br>S1 to S2 DTP Link mode: Access.<br><br>S1 Port F0/1 set to: Dynamic Desirable.<br>S2 Port F0/1 set to: Dynamic Auto.<br>S1 to S2 DTP Link mode: Trunk.<br><br>S1 Port F0/1 set to: Dynamic Desirable.<br>S2 Port F01 set to: Dynamic Desirable.<br>S1 to S2 DTP Link mode: Trunk.<br><br>S1 Port F0/1 set to: Dynamic Desirable.<br>S2 Port F0/1 set to: Trunk.<br>S1 to S2 DTP Link mode: Trunk.<br><br>S1 Port F0/1 set to: Dynamic Desirable.<br>S2 Port F0/1 set to: Access.<br>S1 to S2 DTP Link mode: Access.<br><br>S1 Port F0/1 set to: Trunk.<br>S2 Port F0/1 set to: Dynamic Auto.<br>S1 to S2 DTP Link mode: Trunk.<br><br>S1 Port F0/1 set to: Trunk.<br>S2 Port F0/1 set to: Dynamic Desirable.<br>S1 to S2 DTP Link mode: Trunk.<br><br>S1 Port F0/1 set to: Trunk.<br>S2 Port F0/1 set to: Trunk.<br>S1 to S2 DTP Link mode: Trunk.<br><br>S1 Port F0/1 set to: Trunk.<br>S2 Port F0/1 set to: Access.<br>S1 to S2 DTP Link mode: Not recommended.<br><br>S1 Port F0/1 set to: Access.<br>S2 Port F0/1 set to: Dynamic Auto.<br>S1 to S2 DTP Link mode: Access.<br><br>S1 Port F0/1 set to: Access.<br>S2 Port F0/1 set to: Dynamic Desirable.<br>S1 to S2 DTP Link mode: Access.<br><br>S1 Port F0/1 set to: Access.<br>S2 Port F0/1 set to: Trunk.<br>S1 to S2 DTP Link mode: Not recommended.<br><br>S1 Port F0/1 set to: Access.<br>S2 Port F0/1 set to: Access.<br>S1 to S2 DTP Link mode: Access.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
