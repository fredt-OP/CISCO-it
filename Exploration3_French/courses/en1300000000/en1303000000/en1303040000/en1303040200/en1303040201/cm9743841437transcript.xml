<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a scenario where there is a V LAN and IP subnet configuration problem. Configurations and a solution are provided.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>There are three switches, S1, S2, and S3. Switch S1 port F0/2 is connected to a Web/TFTP server. Switch S1 port F0/1 is connected to S2 port F0/1 using a crossover cable. Switch S1 port F0/3 is connected to S3 port F0/3 using a crossover cable. Switch S2 port F0/11 is connected to PC1. Switch S3 port F0/11 is connected to PC4. <br><br>Web/TFTP Server:<br>V LAN 10<br>172.17.10.30<br><br>PC1:<br>Faculty V LAN 10<br>172.172.10.21<br><br>PC4:<br>Faculty V LAN 10<br>172.17.10.24<br><br>The link between S1 and S2 and between S1 and S3 are trunk links. The allowed V LAN trunks are 10 and 99. The native V LAN is 99.<br><br>Scenario:<br>Computer PC1 cannot connect to the internal Web/TFTP server.<br><br>Configurations:<br>PC1 output from the i p config command shows an IP address of 172.172.10.21, but it should have been configured with 172.17.10.21.<br><br>Solution:<br>Screenshot of the Packet Tracer PC1 configuration to correct the IP address.<br><br>PC1 can now access the Web/TFTP server as indicated by the results of the ping command.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
