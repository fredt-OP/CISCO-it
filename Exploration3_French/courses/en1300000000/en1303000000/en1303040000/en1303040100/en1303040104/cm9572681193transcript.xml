<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a scenario where there is an incorrect V LAN list problem. Configurations and a solution are provided.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>There are three switches, S1, S2, and S3. Switch S1 port F0/2 is connected to a Web/TFTP server. Switch S1 port F0/4 is connected to a Student E-mail server. Switch S1 port F0/1 is connected to S2 port F0/1 using a crossover cable. Switch S1 port F0/3 is connected to S3 port F0/3 using a crossover cable. Switch S3 port F0/11 is connected to PC4. Switch S3 port F0/18 is connected to PC5.<br><br>Web/TFTP Server:<br>V LAN 10<br>172.17.10.30<br><br>Student E-mail Server:<br>V LAN 20<br>172.17.20.10<br><br>PC4:<br>Faculty V LAN 10<br>172.17.10.24<br><br>PC5:<br>Student V LAN 20<br>172.17.20.25<br><br>S1 to S2 and S1 to S3 are trunk links. The allowed V LAN trunks are 10, 20, and 99. The native V LAN is 99.<br><br>Scenario:<br>Computer PC5 cannot connect to the Student E-mail Server.<br><br>Configurations:<br>S3 output from the show interfaces trunk command shows that interface F0/3 is correctly configured to allow V LAN's 10, 20, and 99.<br><br>S1 output from the show interfaces trunk command shows that interface F0/3 only allows V LAN's 10 and 99.<br><br>Solution:<br>Commands issued on S1:<br>S1#config terminal<br>S1(config)#interface F0/3<br>S1(config-i f)#switchport trunk allowed v lan 10, 20, 99<br>S1(config-i f)#end<br><br>S1 output from the show interfaces F0/3 switchport command shows that F0/3 administrative mode is now trunk.<br><br>S1 output from the show interfaces trunk command shows that ports F0/1 and F0/3 allow V LAN's 10, 20, and 99 on the trunk. <br><br>PC4 can now access the Student E-mail server as indicated by the results of the ping command. <br>]]></content-text></brief>
