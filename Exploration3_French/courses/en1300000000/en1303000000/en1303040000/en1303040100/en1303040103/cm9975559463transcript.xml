<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a scenario where there is a trunk mode mismatch problem. Configurations and a solution are provided.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>There are three switches, S1, S2, and S3. Switch S1 port F0/2 is connected to a Web/TFTP server. Switch S1 port F0/1 is connected to S2 port F0/1 using a crossover cable. Switch S1 port F0/3 is connected to S3 port F0/3 using a crossover cable. Switch S3 port F0/11 is connected to PC4.<br><br>Web/TFTP Server:<br>V LAN 10<br>172.17.10.30<br><br>PC4:<br>Faculty V LAN 10<br>172.17.10.24<br><br>Switch S1:<br>Port F0/3<br>Trunk Mode: On<br><br>Switch S3:<br>Port F0/3<br>Trunk Mode: On<br><br>The link from S1 to S2 and the link from S1 to S3 serve as trunk links. The allowed V LAN trunks are 10 and 99. The native V LAN is 99.<br><br>Scenario:<br>Computer PC4 cannot connect to the internal web server, Web/TFTP.<br><br>Configurations:<br>S1 output from the show interfaces trunk command shows that there is no trunk on F0/3:<br>S1 output from the show interfaces F0/3 switchport command shows:<br>Administrative Mode: dynamic auto<br><br>S3 output from the show interfaces trunk command shows that there are no active trunk ports.<br>S3 output from the show interfaces F0/3 switchport command shows:<br>Administrative Mode: dynamic auto<br><br>Solution:<br>Commands issued on S1:<br>S1#config terminal<br>S1(config)#interface F0/3<br>S1(config-i f)#switchport mode trunk<br>S1(config-i f)#end<br><br>S1 output from the show interfaces F0/3 switchport command shows that F0/3 administrative mode is now trunk.<br><br>Commands issued on S3:<br>S3#config terminal<br>S3(config)#interface F0/3<br>S3(config-i f)#switchport mode trunk<br>S3(config-i f)#end<br><br>S3 output from the show interfaces F0/3 switchport command shows that F0/3 administrative mode is now trunk.<br><br>S3 output from the show interfaces trunk command shows that F0/3 mode is on, encapsulation is 802 dot 1q, status is trunking, and the native v lan is 99.<br><br>PC4 can now access the Web/TFTP server as indicated by the results of the ping command. <br>]]></content-text></brief>
