<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a scenario where there is a native V LAN mismatch problem. Configurations and a solution are provided.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>There are two switches, S1 and S3. Switch S1 port F0/2 is connected to a Web/TFTP server. Switch S3 port F0/3 is connected to S1 port F0/3 using a crossover cable. Switch S3 port F0/11 is connected to PC4. <br><br>Web/TFTP Server:<br>V LAN 10<br>172.17.10.30<br><br>PC4:<br>Faculty V LAN 10<br>172.17.10.24<br><br>S1: V LAN 99, IP address 172.17.99.1<br>S3: V LAN 99, IP address 172.17.99.3<br>S1 to S3 Trunk Link - Allowed V LAN trunks are 10 and 99. The native V LAN is 99.<br><br>Scenario:<br>Computer PC4 cannot connect to the internal web server, Web/TFTP.<br><br>Configurations:<br>S3#<br>%CDP-4-NATIVE_V LAN_MISMATCH: Native V LAN mismatch discovered on FastEthernet0/3 (100), with S1 FastEthernet0/3 (99).<br><br>Output from the show interfaces F0/3 switchport command shows:<br>Trunking Native Mode V LAN: 100 (Inactive)<br>Trunking V LAN's Enabled: 10, 99<br><br>Solution:<br>Commands issued on S3: <br>S3#config terminal<br>S3(config)#interface F0/3<br>S3(config-i f)#switchport trunk native v lan 99<br>S3(config-i f)#end<br><br>Output from the show interfaces F0/3 switchport command shows:<br>Name: FA0/3<br>Switchport: Enabled<br>Administrative Mode: trunk<br>Access Mode V LAN: 1 (default)<br>Trunking Native Mode V LAN: 99 (management)<br>Trunking V LAN's Enabled: 10, 99<br><br><br>PC4 can now access the Web/TFTP server as indicated by the results of the ping command. <br>]]></content-text></brief>
