<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts an overview of common problems with V LAN's and trunks.<br>Problem One: Native V LAN mismatches.<br>Result: Poses a security risk and creates unintended results.<br>Example: One port is defined as V LAN 99, and the other is defined as V LAN 100.<br><br>Problem Two: Trunk mode mismatches.<br>Result: Causes loss of network connectivity.<br>Example: One port is configured as trunk mode off, and the other is configured as trunk mode on.<br><br>Problem Three: V LAN's and IP subnets<br>Result: Causes loss of network connectivity.<br>Example: User computers may have been configured with the incorrect IP addresses.<br><br>Problem Four: Allowed V LAN's on trunks<br>Result: Causes unexpected traffic or no traffic being sent over the trunk.<br>Example: The list of allowed V LAN's does not support the current V LAN trunking requirements.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
