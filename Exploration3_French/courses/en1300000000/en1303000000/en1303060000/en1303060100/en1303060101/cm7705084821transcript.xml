<brief><content-text><![CDATA[In this chapter, you have learned: <br>- V LAN's separate broadcast domains on switches.<br>- V LAN's improve network performance, management, and security.<br>- V LAN can be used for data, voice, network protocol, and network management traffic.<br>- There are 3 different membership modes: static, dynamic, and voice V LAN mode.<br>- Routers or Layer 3 switches are required for inter-V LAN communication.<br>- Trunks allow multiple V LAN's to traverse a single link to simplify intra-V LAN communication across multiple switches.<br>- i e e e 802 dot 1Q is the standard trunking protocol.<br>- 802 dot 1Q uses a process of frame tagging to keep V LAN traffic separate as it traverse the trunk link.<br>- 802 dot 1Q does not tag native V LAN traffic, which can result in problems when trunking is misconfigured.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
