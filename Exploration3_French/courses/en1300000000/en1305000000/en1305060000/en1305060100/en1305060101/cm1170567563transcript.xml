<brief><content-text><![CDATA[In this chapter, you have learned: <br>STP prevents loops from being formed in a hierarchical network that implements redundant links.<br>STP uses different port states and timers to prevent loops from occurring.<br>One switch in the network is designated as the root bridge. The root bridge is determined through an election process where BPDU frames are exchanged between neighboring switches in a broadcast domain.<br>All other switches in the network use the spanning-tree algorithm to determine their switch port roles. Switch ports closest to the root bridge become root ports. The remaining non-root ports compete for designated or non-designated roles.<br>Because STP convergence can take up to 50 seconds to complete, RSTP and rapid PVST+ were developed.<br>RSTP reduces the convergence time to a little over 6 seconds.<br>Rapid PVST+ adds V LAN support to RSTP. Rapid PVST+ is the preferred implementation used on a Cisco switch network.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
