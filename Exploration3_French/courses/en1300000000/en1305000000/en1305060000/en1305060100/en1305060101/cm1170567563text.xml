The root bridge is determined through an election process where BPDU frames are exchanged between neighboring switches in a broadcast domain.</li><li>All other switches in the network use the spanning-tree algorithm to determine their switch port roles. Switch ports closest to the root bridge become root ports. The remaining non-root ports compete for designated or non-designated roles.</li><li>Because the spanning-tree protocol convergence can take up to 50 seconds to complete RSTP, and the rapid PVST+ were developed.</li><li>RSTP reduces the convergence time to a little over 6 seconds.</li><li>Rapid PVST+ adds VLAN support to RSTP. The rapid PVST+ is the preferred spanning-tree protocol implementation used on a Cisco switch network.</li></ul></td>
