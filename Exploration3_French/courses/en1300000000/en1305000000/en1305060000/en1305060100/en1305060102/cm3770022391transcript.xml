<brief><content-text><![CDATA[This is a review and is not a quiz. Questions and answers are provided. <br>Question One. Which of the following statements are true and which are false?<br>Answers:<br>A. Ethernet frames do not have a time to live (TTL). True.<br><br>B. Broadcast frames are forwarded out all switch ports, except the originating port. True.<br><br>C. In a hierarchical design, redundancy is achieved at the Distribution Layer and Core Layer through additional hardware and alternate paths through the additional hardware. True.<br><br>D. Layer 2 loops result in low CPU load on all switches caught in the loop. False.<br><br>E. A broadcast storm results when there are so many broadcast frames caught in a Layer 2 loop that all available bandwidth is consumed. True.<br><br>F. Most upper layer protocols are designed to recognize or cope with duplicate transmissions. False.<br><br>G. Layer 2 loops arise as a result of multiple paths, and STP can be used to block these loops. True.<br><br>Question Two. A converged STP topology is pictured with switch S1 as the root bridge. Fill in the boxes with the appropriate description: root port, designated port, or non-designated port. <br>Answer:<br>Refer to the following diagram description to answer the question.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Three switches, S1, S2, and S3, are interconnected in a full mesh.<br>Switch S1 port F0/1 is connected to S2 port F0/1 (Trunk 1).<br>Switch S2 port F0/2 is connected to S3 port F0/2 (Trunk 2).<br>Switch S3 port F0/1 is connected to S1 port F0/2 (Trunk 3).<br>The S3 port F0/2 is in the blocking state.<br>Switch S1 is connected to PC3, which has IP address 172.17.10.27.<br>Three PC's, PC1, PC2, and PC3, are connected to switch S2 ports F0/11, F0/18, and F0/6, respectively. The PC1 IP address is 172.17.10.21, the PC2 IP address is 172.17.10.22, and the PC3 IP address is 172.17.10.23.<br><br>Ports to be identified their role:<br>Switch S1 Port F0/1 = Designated port<br>Switch S1 Port F0/2 = Designated port<br>Switch S2 Port F0/1 = Root port<br>Switch S2 Port F0/2 = Designated port<br>Switch S3 Port F0/1 = Root port<br>Switch S3 Port F0/2 = Non-designated port<br><br>Question Three. Refer to the command output below. What can be concluded about interface Fa0/2?<br><br>Command output:<br><br>S3#show spanning-tree<br>V LAN 0001<br>  Spanning tree enabled protocol i e e e<br>Root ID	Priority 	27577<br>Address	000A.0033.3333<br>Hello Time	2 sec Max Age 20 sec Forward Delay 15 sec<br>Bridge ID 	Priority	32769 (priority 32768 sys-id-ext 1)<br>Address	000A.0022.2222<br>Hello Time	2 sec Max Age 20 sec Forward Delay 15 sec<br>Aging Time 	300<br><br>Interface:	Role 	Sts	Cost	Prio.

It is a root port.<br><br>The answer is B. <br><br>Question Four. Match the term on the left with the appropriate description.<br><br>Terms:<br>PVST = Answer D<br>PVST+ = Answer C<br>RSTP = Answer E<br>MSTP = Answer B<br>802 dot 1D = Answer A<br><br>Descriptions: <br>A.
