<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts loops in the wiring closet in a hierarchical network with multiple switches. The examples provided are a non-redundant hierarchical network, a loop from two connections to the same switch, and a loop from a connection to a second switch on the same network.<br><br>Example One - Non-redundant hierarchical network topology:<br>Three Access Layer switches, S1, S2, and S3, are connected to two Distribution Layer switches, D1 and D2, which are connected to two Core Layer switches, C1 and C2. <br><br>Switch S1 is connected to switch D1.<br>Switch D1 is connected to C1.<br>Switches S2 and S3 are connected to D2.<br>Switch D2 is connected to C2.<br>Switch C1 is connected to C2.<br><br>Example Two - Loop from two connections to the same switch:<br>Same topology as Example One, but there are two links between switches S1 and D1, which forms a loop.<br><br>Example Three - Loop from a connection to a second switch on the same network:<br>Same topology as Example One, but there is a link from switches S1 to D1 and from switches S1 to D2, which forms a larger multi-switch loop.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
