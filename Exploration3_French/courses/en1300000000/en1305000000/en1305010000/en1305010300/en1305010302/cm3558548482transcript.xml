<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts loops in user cubicles in a hierarchical network with multiple switches. The examples provided are two hubs connected to the same switch, and a loop from two interconnected hubs.<br><br>Example One - Two hubs connected to the same switch:<br>Three Access Layer switches, S1, S2, and S3, are connected to two Distribution Layer switches, D1 and D2, which are connected to two Core Layer switches, C1 and C2. <br><br>Switch S1 is connected to switch D1.<br>Switch D1 is connected to C1.<br>Switches S2 and S3 are connected to D2.<br>Switch D2 is connected to C2.<br>Switches C1 and C2 are connected.<br>PC1 is connected to Hub1<br>PC2 is connected to Hub2.<br>Hub1 and Hub2 are connected to switch S1.<br><br>Example Two - Loop from two interconnected hubs:<br>Same topology as Example One. Two hubs are connected to the same switch, but the two hubs are now also connected to each other forming a loop.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
