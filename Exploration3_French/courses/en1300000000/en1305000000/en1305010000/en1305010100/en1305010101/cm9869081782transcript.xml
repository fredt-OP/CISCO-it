<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts redundancy in a hierarchical network with multiple switches interconnected in a full mesh. <br><br>Network Topology:<br>Three switches, S1, S2, and S3, are interconnected in a full mesh. The device connections are as follows:<br>Switch S1 port F0/1 is connected to S2 port F0/1 (Trunk 1).<br>Switch S2 port F0/2 is connected to S3 port F0/2 (Trunk 2).<br>Switch S3 port F0/1 is connected to S1 port F0/2 (Trunk 3).<br>Switch S1 port F0/3 is connected to PC4 with IP address 172.17.10.27.<br>PC1, PC2, and PC3 are connected to switch S2 ports F0/11, F0/18, and F0/6 respectively.<br>The PC1 IP address is 172.17.10.21, the PC2 IP address is 172.17.10.22, and the PC3 IP address is 172.17.10.23.<br><br>Animation Sequence:<br>One. PC1 is communicating with PC4 over Trunk 1.<br><br>Two. Trunk 1 is broken between switches S2 and S1. The data frame is unable to reach switch S1 over Trunk 1.<br><br>Three. Switch S2 detects the broken connection to switch S1 and changes its forwarding path to go through switch S3.<br><br>Four. Switch S2 detects that the link to switch S1 has been restored. Switch S2 adjusts the path to PC4 to go back through switch S1.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
