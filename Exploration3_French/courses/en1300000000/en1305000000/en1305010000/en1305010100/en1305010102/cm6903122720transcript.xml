<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts various scenarios in examining a three-layer switched-network redundant design. Alternate paths through the switches are taken based on the failure scenario.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Six Access Layer switches, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6, are connected to four Distribution Layer switches, D1, D2, D3, and D4. The Distribution Layer switches are connected to Core Layer switches C1 and C2. <br><br>The device connections are as follows: <br>Switches S1, S2, and S3 are each connected to switches D1 and D2.<br>Switches S4, S5, and S6 are each connected to D3 and D4.<br>Switches D1 and D2 are connected to C1.<br>Switches D3 and D4 are connected to C2.<br>Core Layer switches C1 and C2 are connected.<br>PC1 is connected to Access Layer switch S1.<br>PC4 is connected to Access Layer switch S6.<br><br>The initial path is shown from host PC1 to PC4 through the Access, Distribution, and Core layers. Alternate paths are selected based on which link or switch fails.<br><br>Starting point: Access Layer to Distribution Layer to Core Layer.<br>Path: PC1 to S1 to D1 to C2 to D4 to S6 to PC4 <br><br>Path failure: Access Layer to Distribution Layer (S1 to D1 link fails).<br>Alternate path: PC1 to S1 to D2 to C2 to D4 to S6 to PC4<br><br>Path failure distribution to Core Layer (D1 to C2 link fails).<br>Alternate path: PC1 to S1 to D1 to C1 to D4 to S6 to PC4<br><br>Switch failure at Distribution Layer (D1 switch fails).<br>Alternate path: PC1 to S1 to D2 to C2 to D4 to S6 to PC4<br><br>Switch failure at Core Layer (C2 switch fails).<br>Alternate Path: PC1 to S1 to D1 to C1 to D4 to S6 to PC4<br>]]></content-text></brief>
