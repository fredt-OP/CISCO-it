<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts duplicate unicast frames in a network with multiple switches and redundant links between them.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Three switches, S1, S2, and S3, are interconnected in a full mesh. <br>Switch S1 port F0/1 is connected to S2 port F0/1 (Trunk 1).<br>Switch S2 port F0/2 is connected to S3 port F0/2 (Trunk 2).<br>Switch S3 port F0/1 is connected to S1 port F0/2 (Trunk 3).<br>Switch S1 port F0/5 is connected to PC4 with IP address 172.17.10.27.<br>PC1, PC2, and PC3 are connected to switch S2 ports F0/11, F0/18, and F0/6, respectively.<br>The PC1 IP address is 172.17.10.21, the PC2 IP address is 172.17.10.22, and the PC3 IP address is 172.17.10.23.<br><br>Switch MAC address tables:<br>S1: S1 MAC Table<br> PC4 = F0/5<br>S2: S2 MAC Table<br> PC1 = F0/11<br>S3: S3 MAC Table<br> PC4 = F0/1<br><br>Animation sequence:<br>One. PC1 sends a unicast frame to switch S2 destined for PC4.<br><br>Two. Switch S2 does not have a record for PC4 in its MAC address table, so it floods the unicast frame out all switch ports.<br><br>Three. Switch S1 does have an entry for PC4 in its MAC address table, so it forwards the frame to PC4 on port F0/5. Switch S3 also has a record for PC4 in its MAC address table, so it forwards the unicast frame out Trunk 3 to switch S1.<br><br>Four. Switch S1 forwards the duplicate unicast frame received from switch S3 to PC4. <br>]]></content-text></brief>
