<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts broadcast storms in a network with multiple switches and redundant links between them.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Three switches, S1, S2, and S3, are interconnected in a full mesh. <br>Switch S1 port F0/1 is connected to S2 port F0/1 (Trunk 1).<br>Switch S2 port F0/2 is connected to S3 port F0/2 (Trunk 2).<br>Switch S3 port F0/1 is connected to S1 port F0/2 (Trunk 3).<br>Switch S1 port F0/3 is connected to PC4 with IP address 172.17.10.27.<br>PC1, PC2, and PC3 are connected to switch S2 ports F0/11, F0/18, and F0/6, respectively.<br>The PC1 IP address is 172.17.10.21, the PC2 IP address is 172.17.10.22, and the PC3 IP address is 172.17.10.23.<br><br>Animation sequence:<br>One. PC1 sends a broadcast onto the network. The broadcast gets caught in a Layer 2 loop.<br><br>Two. PC4 sends a broadcast onto the network. The broadcast gets caught in a Layer 2 loop, along with the broadcast frame from PC1. <br><br>Three. PC3 sends a broadcast onto the network. The broadcast gets caught in a Layer 2 loop, along with the broadcast frames from PC1 and PC4.<br><br>Four. PC2 sends a broadcast onto the network. The broadcast frame cannot be processed because of the high volume of traffic already caught in the loop. The network is unable to process new traffic. <br>]]></content-text></brief>
