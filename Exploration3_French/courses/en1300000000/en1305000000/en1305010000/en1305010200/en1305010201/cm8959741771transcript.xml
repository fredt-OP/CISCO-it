<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts Layer 2 loops in a network with multiple switches and redundant links between them.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Three switches, S1, S2, and S3, are interconnected in a full mesh. Device connections are as follows:<br>Switch S1 port F0/1 is connected to S2 port F0/1 (Trunk 1).<br>Switch S2 port F0/2 is connected to S3 port F0/2 (Trunk 2).<br>Switch S3 port F0/1 is connected to S1 port F0/2 (Trunk 3).<br>Switch S1 port F0/3 is connected to PC4 with IP address 172.17.10.27.<br>PC1, PC2, and PC3 are connected to switch S2 ports F0/11, F0/18, and F0/6, respectively.<br>The PC1 IP address is 172.17.10.21, the PC2 IP address is 172.17.10.22, and the PC3 IP address is 172.17.10.23.<br><br>Animation sequence:<br>One. PC1 sends a broadcast to switch S2. Switch S2 updates its MAC address table with PC1's MAC address on port F0/11.<br><br>Two. Switch S2 forwards the broadcast to switch S3 over Trunk 2 and to switch S1 over Trunk 1. Switches S3 and S1 update their MAC address tables with the MAC address of PC1 on their trunk ports.<br><br>S1: S1 MAC Table<br> PC1 = F0/1<br>S2: S2 MAC Table<br> PC1 = F0/11<br>S3: S3 MAC Table<br> PC1 = F0/2<br><br>Three. Switch S3 forwards the broadcast to switch S1. Switch S1 forwards the broadcast to switch S3. Both switches update their MAC address table entries with the new port on which it received the broadcast.<br><br>S1: S1 MAC Table<br> PC1 = F0/2<br>S2: S2 MAC Table<br> PC1 = F0/11<br>S3: S3 MAC Table<br> PC1 = F0/1<br><br>Four. Switches S3 and S1 forward the broadcast back to switch S2. Switch S2 updates its MAC address table entry for PC1 with the last port on which it received the broadcast.<br><br>S1: S1 MAC Table<br> PC1 = F0/2<br>S2: S2 MAC Table<br> PC1 = F0/1<br>S3: S3 MAC Table<br> PC1 = F0/1<br><br>Five. Switch S2 forwards the broadcast frame out trunks 1 and 2 to switches S3 and S1. Switches S3 and S1 update their MAC address tables with the new entry for PC1.<br><br>S1: S1 MAC Table<br> PC1 = F0/1<br>S2: S2 MAC Table<br> PC1 = F0/1<br>S3: S3 MAC Table<br> PC1 = F0/2]]></content-text></brief>
