<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the benefits of Layer 3 switching in hierarchical network design.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Six switches are shown. S1 and S2 are Access Layer switches, each with three PC's attached. D1 and D2 are Distribution Layer switches, and C1 and C2 are Core Layer switches.<br>Switch S1 connects to D1.<br>Switch S2 connects to D2.<br>Switch D1 connects C1 and C2.<br>Switch D2 connects C1 and C2.<br>Switches C1 and C2 are connected to each other.<br>Users on V LAN 20 are connected to switch S1.<br>Users on V LAN 30 are connected to switch S2.<br><br>C1 and C2 are Layer 3 switches and are connected to each other using a routed link. Redundancy is still present, with a reliance on Layer 3 routing protocols. The design ensures a convergence that is even faster than convergence with STP. STP no longer blocks any single port, so there is no potential for a bridging loop. <br>]]></content-text></brief>
