<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the benefits of hierarchical design and pruning V LAN's using STP and manual pruning.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Six switches are shown. S1 and S2 are Access Layer switches, each with three PC's attached. D1 and D2 are Distribution Layer switches, and C1 and C2 are Core Layer switches.<br>Switch S1 connects to D1.<br>Switch S2 connects to D2.<br>Switch D1 connects C1 and C2.<br>Switch D2 connects C1 and C2.<br>Switches C1 and C2 are connected to each other.<br>Users on V LAN 20 are connected to switch S1. <br>Users on V LAN 30 are connected to switch S2.<br>Switches D1 and D2 are each blocking one of the ports to C1 or C2.<br><br>All switch links are trunks.<br><br>VTP Pruning:<br>The diagram depicts the Distribution Layer switches as dual-attached to two Core Layer switches, C1 and C2. Users that connect on switch D1 are all in V LAN 20; switch D2 only connects users in V LAN 30. By default, trunks carry all the V LAN's defined in the VTP domain. Only switch D1 receives unnecessary broadcast and multicast traffic for V LAN 20, but it is also blocking one of its ports for V LAN 30. There are three redundant paths between C1 and C2. This redundancy results in more blocked ports and a higher likelihood of a loop.<br><br>Manual Pruning:<br>VTP pruning can help, but it is not necessary in the core of the network. The diagram shows only an access V LAN used to connect the distribution switches to the core. In this design, only one port is blocked per V LAN.<br><br>]]></content-text></brief>
