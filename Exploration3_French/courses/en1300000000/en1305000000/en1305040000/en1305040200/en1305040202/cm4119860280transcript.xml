<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the structure of the Cisco PVST+ Bridge ID. <br><br>PVST+ requires that a separate instance of spanning tree run for each V LAN. To support PVST+, the 8-byte B ID field is modified to carry a V LAN ID (V ID). In the diagram, the bridge priority field is reduced from 2 bytes in the original 802 dot 1D standard to 4 bits, and a new 12-bit field, the extended system ID field, contains the V ID. The 6-byte MAC address remains unchanged. <br><br>The following provides more details on the PVST+ fields:<br>Bridge priority - A 4-bit field carries the bridge priority.<br>Extended system ID - A 12-bit field carries the V ID for PVST+. <br>MAC address - A 6-byte field with the MAC address of a single switch. <br><br>The MAC address is what makes a B ID unique. When the priority and extended system ID are prepended to the switch MAC address, each V LAN on the switch can be represented by a unique B ID.<br><br>PVST+ Bridge ID Example:<br>Three switches, S1, S2, and S3, are interconnected in a full mesh.<br>Switch S1 port F0/2 is connected to S2 port F0/2.<br>Switch S2 port F0/3 is connected to S3 port F0/1<br>Switch S3 port F0/4 is connected to S1 port F0/4.<br><br>Switch S1 is the root bridge for V LAN 10.<br>Switch S3 is the root bridge for V LAN 20.<br><br>Switch S1 Bridge ID:<br>Priority + V LAN ID + MAC Address = B ID<br>32768  +  10  + 000A.0033.3333 = 32778.000A.0033.3333<br>32768  +  20  + 000A.0033.3333 = 32788.000A.0033.3333<br>]]></content-text></brief>
