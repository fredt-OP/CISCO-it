<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts Cisco and other STP variants.<br>Cisco Proprietary STP Variants.<br><br>PVST:<br>Uses the Cisco proprietary ISL trunking protocol.<br>Each V LAN has an instance of spanning tree.<br>Ability to load balance traffic at Layer 2.<br>Includes the BackboneFast, UplinkFast, and PortFast extensions.<br>PVST+:<br>Supports ISL and i e e e 802 dot 1Q trunking.<br>Supports Cisco proprietary STP extensions.<br>Adds BPDU guard and Root guard enhancements.<br>rapid-PVST+:<br>Based on the i e e e 802 dot 1w standard.<br>Has faster convergence than 802 dot 1D.<br><br>i e e e Standard STP Variants.<br><br>RSTP:<br>Introduced in 1982, it provides faster convergence than 802 dot 1D.<br>Implements generic versions of the Cisco proprietary STP extensions.<br>i e e e has incorporated RSTP into 802 dot 1D, identifying the specification as i e e e 802 dot 1D-2004.<br><br>MSTP<br>Multiple V LAN's can be mapped to the same spanning-tree instance.<br>Inspired by the Cisco Multiple Instances Spanning Tree Protocol (MISTP).<br>i e e e 802 dot 1Q-2003 now includes MSTP.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
