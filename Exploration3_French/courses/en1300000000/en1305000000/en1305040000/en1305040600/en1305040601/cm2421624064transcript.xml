<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the three RTSP port states: discarding, learning, and forwarding.<br><br>Discarding:<br>The discarding state occurs in both a stable active topology and during topology synchronization and changes. The discarding state prevents the forwarding of data frames, thus breaking the continuity of a Layer 2 loop.<br><br>Learning:<br>The learning state occurs in both a stable active topology and during topology synchronization and changes. The learning state accepts data frames to populate the MAC table to limit the flooding of unknown unicast frames.<br><br>Forwarding:<br>The forwarding state occurs only in stable active topologies. The forwarding switch ports determine the topology. After a topology change or during synchronization, data frames are forwarded only after a proposal and agreement process.<br><br>Comparing STP and RSTP Port States:<br><br>Operational Port State: Enabled<br>STP Port State: Blocking<br>RSTP Port State: Discarding<br><br>Operational Port State: Enabled<br>STP Port State: Listening<br>RSTP Port State: Discarding<br><br>Operational Port State: Enabled<br>STP Port State: Learning<br>RSTP Port State: Learning<br><br>Operational Port State: Enabled<br>STP Port State: Forwarding<br>RSTP Port State: Forwarding<br><br>Operational Port State: Disabled<br>STP Port State: Disabled<br>RSTP Port State: Discarding<br>]]></content-text></brief>
