<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP). RSTP (i e e e 802 dot 1w) is an evolution of the 802 dot 1D standard. RSTP characteristics are listed.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Three switches, S1, S2, and S3 are interconnected in a full mesh.<br>Switch S1 port F0/2 is connected to S2 port F0/2.<br>Switch S2 port F0/3 is connected to S3 port F0/1.<br>Switch S3 port F0/4 is connected to S1 port F0/4.<br>All inter-switch links are 801 dot 1Q trunks.<br><br>The diagram depicts switch S1 as the root bridge, with two designated ports in a forwarding state. RSTP supports a new port type. Port F0/3 on switch S2 is an alternate port in discarding state. There are no blocking ports, because RSTP does not have a blocking port state. RSTP defines port states as discarding, learning, or forwarding.<br><br>RSTP Characteristics:<br>Preferred protocol for preventing Layer 2 loops in a switched network.<br>Transparently integrates Cisco-proprietary enhancements, such as BPDU's sending proposals and agreements to neighbor switches.<br>Performs better than the earlier Cisco-proprietary enhancements.<br>Not compatible with some Cisco-proprietary enhancements, such as UplinkFast and BackboneFast.<br>Defines different port states and port roles.<br>Backward compatible with 802 dot 1D.<br>Most configuration parameters unchanged.<br>Same BPDU format as the i e e e 802 dot 1D BPDU.<br>Does not need 802 dot 1D timers.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
