<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Activity One. The diagram depicts an activity in which you must indicate which STP or RSTP port states are related to each other when associated with a specific operation port state.<br><br>Operation Port States:<br>-	Enabled<br>-	Disabled<br><br>STP Port States:<br>-	Blocking<br>-	Listening<br>-	Learning<br>-	Forwarding<br>-	Disabled<br><br>RSTP Port States:<br>-	Discarding<br>-	Learning<br>-	Forwarding<br><br>Activity Two. The diagram depicts an activity in which you must indicate which port type is associated with each port in the diagram. <br><br>Network Topology:<br>Four switches, S1, S2, S3, and S4, are interconnected. Switches S1, S2, and S3 are connected in a full mesh. Switch S4 connects to S1. Three PC's are connected to switch S3. A database is connected to S4.<br><br>RP = Root port<br>DP = Designated port<br>AP = Alternate port<br>EP = Edge port<br><br>Switch S1 has the following information associated with it:<br>Priority = 32769<br>MAC Address = 000A00111111<br><br>Switch S2 has the following information associated with it:<br>Priority = 24577<br>MAC Address = 000A00333333<br><br>Switch S3 has the following information associated with it:<br>Priority = 32769<br>MAC Address = 000A00222222<br><br>Switch S4 has the following information associated with it:<br>Priority = 32769<br>MAC Address = 000A00444444<br><br><br>Note: Contact your instructor for assistance with this activity.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
