<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a PortFast configuration error on a switch port that connects two switches.<br><br>Switch S1 is connected to switch S2 with a single link, initially using designated port F0/1, which is in the forwarding state. Then a second link is added to port F0/2 that is configured with PortFast, but should not be.<br><br>Step 1. The second link cable is connected from S2 to S1 PortFast F0/2.<br>Step 2. A transparent loop results, with port F0/1 and F0/2 forwarding.<br>Step 3. Port F0/2 receives a BPDU, and port F0/2 is in blocking mode.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
