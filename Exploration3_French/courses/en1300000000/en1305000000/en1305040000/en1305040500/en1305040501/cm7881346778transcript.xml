<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the two RSTP link types, point-to-point and shared. <br><br>Network Topology:<br>Three switches, S1, S2, and S3, are connected in a full mesh. Hub H1 connects to S1. Router R1 connects to H1. Three PC's are connected to switch S2.<br><br>The links from the PC's to the switches and the links interconnecting the switches are point-to-point links. The link from the hub to switch S1 is a shared link.<br><br>Switch S1 is the root bridge. The S2 ports to the PC's are edge ports. The S2 port to S1 and the S3 port to S1 are root ports (F in the diagram = Forwarding). The S2 port to S3 is an alternate port (DIS in the diagram = Discarding). The S1 ports to S2 and S3 are designated ports (F), as is the S3 port to S2. <br><br>Point-to-Point Link Type:<br>This link type is attached to switch ports that are operating in full-duplex mode.<br>This link connects to a single switch device.<br><br>Shared Link Type:<br>This link type is attached to a port that is operating in half-duplex mode.<br>The port is connected to a shared media where multiple switches might exist.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
