<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts information on BPDU timers, the STP states and timers, and configuring network diameter.<br><br>BPDU Timers:<br>Hello time - The time between each BPDU frame that is sent on a port. By default, this is 2 seconds, but it can be set between 1 and 10 seconds.<br><br>Forward delay - The time spent in the listening and learning state. By default, this is 15 seconds for each state, but it can be set between 4 and 30 seconds.<br><br>Maximum age - The max age timer controls the maximum length of time a switch port saves configuration BPDU information. By default, this is 20 seconds, but it can be set between 6 and 40 seconds.<br><br>Port States and Timers:<br>Blocking<br>(loss of BPDU detected)<br>(max age = 20 sec)<br><br>Listening<br>(forward delay = 15 sec)<br><br>Learning <br>(forward delay = 15 sec)<br><br>Forwarding<br><br>Note: When a link comes up, it is initially in the blocking state and moves to listening after it decides if it is a root port or a designated port.<br><br>Configuring Network Diameter:<br>S1(config)#spanning-tree v lan 1 root primary diameter 5<br>]]></content-text></brief>
