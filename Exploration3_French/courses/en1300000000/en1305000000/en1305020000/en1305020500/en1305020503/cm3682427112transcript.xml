<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts Cisco PortFast technology, including configuring and verifying PortFast.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Three switches, S1, S2, and S3, are interconnected in a full mesh. <br>Switch S1 port F0/1 is connected to S2 port F0/1 (Trunk 1).<br>Switch S2 port F0/2 is connected to S3 port F0/2 (Trunk 2).<br>Switch S3 port F0/1 is connected to S1 port F0/2 (Trunk 3).<br>PC1, PC2, and PC3 are connected to switch S2 ports F0/11, F0/18, and F0/6, respectively.<br>The PC1 IP address is 172.17.10.21, the PC2 IP address is 172.17.10.22, and the PC3 IP address is 172.17.10.23.<br><br>Note: Switch S3 port F0/2 is placed in blocking state by STP to prevent switching loops. This port has a red "X" on it.<br><br>PortFast:<br>The three ports, F0/11, F0/18, and F0/6, that are connected to PC1, PC2, and PC3 are configured using PortFast.<br><br>Configuring PortFast:<br>Enable PortFast:<br>S2(config)#interface f0/11<br>S2(config-i f)#spanning-tree portfast<br><br>Warning: PortFast should only be enabled on ports connected to a single host. Connecting hubs, concentrators, switches, bridges, and so on to this interface when PortFast is enabled, can cause temporary bridging loops. Use with caution.<br><br>PortFast has been configured on FastEthernet 0/11, but only takes effect when the interface is in non-trunking mode. <br>S2(config-i f)#end<br><br>Disable PortFast:<br>S2(config)#interface f0/11<br>S2(config-i f)#no spanning-tree portfast<br><br>Verify PortFast:<br>S2#show running-config<br>{output omitted}<br>!<br>Interface FastEthernet 0/11<br>Switchport mode access<br>Spanning-tree portfast<br>!<br>{output omitted}<br>End<br>S2#]]></content-text></brief>
