<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the B ID fields and root bridge selection examples based on priority and MAC address. <br><br>B ID fields:<br>Without the Extended System ID:<br>Bridge Priority (2 bytes)<br>MAC Address (6 bytes)<br><br>With the Extended System ID:<br>Bridge Priority (4 bits)<br>Extended System ID (12 bits)<br>MAC Address (48 bits or 6 bytes)<br><br>Priority-based decision:<br>Network Topology:<br>Three switches, S1, S2, and S3, are interconnected in a full mesh. <br>Switch S1 port F0/1 is connected to S2 port F0/1 (Trunk 1).<br>Switch S2 port F0/2 is connected to S3 port F0/2 (Trunk 2).<br>Switch S3 port F0/1 is connected to S1 port F0/2 (Trunk 3).<br>Switch S1 port F0/3 is connected to PC4 with IP address 172.17.10.27.<br>PC1, PC2, and PC3 are connected to switch S2 ports F0/11, F0/18, and F0/6, respectively.<br>The PC1 IP address is 172.17.10.21, the PC2 IP address is 172.17.10.22, and the PC3 IP address is 172.17.10.23.<br><br>Switch S1 Bridge ID:<br>Priority = 24577<br>MAC Address = 000A00333333<br><br>Switch S2 Bridge ID:<br>Priority = 32769<br>MAC Address = 000A00111111<br><br>Switch S3 Bridge ID:<br>Priority = 32769<br>MAC Address = 000A00222222<br><br>Switch S1 is determined to be the root bridge based on its better (lower) priority number of 24577.<br><br>MAC address-based decision:<br>Network Topology:<br>Same topology as the priority-based decision.<br><br>Switch S1 Bridge ID:<br>Priority = 32769<br>MAC Address = 000A00333333<br><br>Switch S2 Bridge ID:<br>Priority = 32769<br>MAC Address = 000A00111111<br><br>Switch S3 Bridge ID:<br>Priority = 32769<br>MAC Address = 000A00222222<br><br>Switch S2 is determined to be the root bridge based on its lower MAC address of 000A00111111.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
