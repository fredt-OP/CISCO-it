<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts spanning-tree port roles.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Three switches, S1, S2, and S3, are interconnected in a full mesh. <br>Switch S1 port F0/1 is connected to S2 port F0/1 (Trunk 1).<br>Switch S2 port F0/2 is connected to S3 port F0/2 (Trunk 2).<br>Switch S3 port F0/1 is connected to S1 port F0/2 (Trunk 3).<br>Switch S1 port F0/3 is connected to PC4 with IP address 172.17.10.27.<br>PC1, PC2, and PC3 are connected to switch S2 ports F0/11, F0/18. and F0/6, respectively.<br>The PC1 IP address is 172.17.10.21, the PC2 IP address is 172.17.10.22, and the PC3 IP address is 172.17.10.23.<br><br>STP Port Roles:<br>Root Bridge: Switch S1<br>Root Ports: Switch S3 port F0/1 and switch S2 port F0/1<br>Designated ports: Switch 1 ports F0/1 and F0/2, and switch S2 port F0/2<br>Non-designated ports: Switch S3 port F0/2<br><br>Note: Switch S3 port F0/2 is placed in blocking state by STP to prevent switching loops. This port has a red "X" on it.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
