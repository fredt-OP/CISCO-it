<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts STP port role decisions.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Three switches, S1, S2, and S3, are interconnected in a full mesh.<br>Switch S1 port F0/1 is connected to S2 port F0/1 (Trunk 1).<br>Switch S2 port F0/2 is connected to S3 port F0/2 (Trunk 2).<br>Switch S3 port F0/1 is connected to S1 port F0/2 (Trunk 3). <br><br>Step 1: Switch S1 has the lowest bridge priority and is therefore the root bridge.<br><br>Step 2: Switch S1 configures both of its trunk ports as designated ports.<br><br>Step 3: Switch S2 configures port F0/1 as a root port.<br>Switch S3 configures port F0/1 as a root port.<br><br>Step 4: Switches S2 and S3 share a common LAN segment. They need to determine which switch has the lower B ID to identify which switch can configure its port as a designated port.<br><br>Step 5: Switches S2 and S3 exchange BPDU frames. Switch 3 identifies switch S2 as having a lower B ID based on the lower MAC address of switch S2.<br><br>Step 6: Switch 3 configures port F0/2 as a non-designated port and enters the blocked state preventing the loop.<br><br>Step 7: Because switch S2 has the lower B ID, it configures its F0/2 port as a designated port to complete the spanning tree.<br><br>At the end of Step 7 the following information applies to the switch ports:<br><br>Port Roles:<br>Root port = R<br>Designated port = D <br>Non-designated port = N.<br><br>Switch S1 Port F0/1 (D):<br>Root ID = 24577.000A00333333<br>Bridge ID = 24577.000A00333333<br>Path Cost = 19<br><br> Switch S1 Port F0/2 (D):<br>Root ID = 24577.000A00333333<br>Bridge ID = 24577.000A00333333<br>Path Cost = 19<br><br>Switch S2 Port F0/1 (R):<br>Root ID = 24577.000A00333333<br>Bridge ID = 32769.000A00111111<br>Path Cost = 19<br><br>Switch S2 Port F0/2 (D):<br>Root ID = 24577.000A00333333<br>Bridge ID = 32769.000A00111111<br>Path Cost = 19<br><br>Switch S3 Port F0/1 (R):<br>Root ID = 24577.000A00333333<br>Bridge ID = 32769.000A00222222<br>Path Cost = 19<br><br>Switch S3 Port F0/2 (N):<br>Root ID = 24577.000A00333333<br>Bridge ID = 32769.000A00222222<br>Path Cost = 19]]></content-text></brief>
