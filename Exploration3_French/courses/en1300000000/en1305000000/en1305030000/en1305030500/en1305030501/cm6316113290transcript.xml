<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the STP topology change notification process.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>There are three Access Layer switches, S1, S2, and S3; two Distribution Layer switches, D1 and D2; and one Core Layer switch, C1, which is the root bridge. Switches S1 and S2 are connected to D1. Switch S3 is connected to D2. Switches D1 and D2 are connected to C1.<br><br>Topology Change: <br>Switch S2 experiences a topology change. Switch S2 sends a topology change notification (TCN) BPDU to its designated bridge, which is switch D1. Switch D1 receives the TCN, acknowledges it back to switch S2 with a topology change acknowledgement (TCA) BPDU. Switch D1 generates a TCN and forwards it to its designated bridge, which is the root bridge.<br><br>Broadcast Notification:<br>The root bridge sends out its configuration BPDU's with the topology change (TC) bit set. These BPDU's are relayed by every switch in the network with this bit set. All switches become aware of the topology change and can alter port roles accordingly.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
