<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a spoofing attack and Cisco Catalyst DHCP snooping and port security features. <br><br>Spoofing:<br>Image: There are two Layer 2 switches connected by a link. A Layer 3 switch and a rogue DHCP attacker is connected to one of the Layer 2 switches. A legitimate DHCP server is also connected to the Layer 3 switch. A regular DHCP client is connected to the other Layer 2 switch.<br><br>One. An attacker activates a DHCP server on a network segment.<br>Two. The client broadcasts a request for DHCP configuration information.<br>Three. The rogue DHCP server responds before the legitimate DHCP server can respond, assigning attacker-defined IP configuration information.<br>Four. Host packets are redirected to the attacker's address because it emulates a default gateway for the erroneous DHCP address provided to the client.<br><br>DHCP Snooping<br>Image: Same as for spoofing but the Layer 3 switch port connected to the legitimate DHCP server is now labeled as a Trusted Port, and the port connected to the Rogue DHCP Attacker is now labeled as an Untrusted Port<br><br>DHCP snooping allows ports to be configured as trusted or untrusted.<br>- Trusted ports can send DHCP requests and acknowledgements.<br>- Untrusted ports can only forward DHCP requests.<br><br>DHCP snooping enables the switch to build a DHCP binding table that maps a client MAC address, IP address, V LAN, and port ID. <br><br>Use the i p dhcp snooping command.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
