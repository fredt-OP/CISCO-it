<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a MAC address flooding attack. There are three host PC's labeled MAC A, MAC B, and MAC C connected to a common switch. MAC A is connected to switch Port 1. MAC B is connected to switch Port 2, and MAC C is connected to switch Port 3. The MAC address table shows MAC A on switch Port 1 and MAC C on switch Port 3. The steps in the MAC address flooding attack are as follows:<br><br>Step 1:<br>The MAC address table is incomplete.<br>B is unknown, so the switch floods the frame.<br>MAC C sees traffic to MAC B.<br>Step 2:<br>The MAC address table learns that B is on Port 2.<br>C drops the packet addressed to B.<br>Step 3:<br>MAC address tables are limited in size.<br>The MAC address table has learned B is on Port 2.<br>MAC C does not see traffic to MAC B anymore.<br>Step 4:<br>An intruder runs an attack tool on MAC C.<br>Bogus addresses are added to the MAC address table.<br>X and Y are on Port 3, and the MAC address table is updated.<br>Attacker starts sending unknown bogus MAC addresses.<br>Step 5:<br>The MAC address table is full.<br>MAC B is unknown, so the switch floods the frame looking for MAC B.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
