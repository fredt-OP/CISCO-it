<brief><content-text><![CDATA[In this chapter, you have learned: <br>- The 8 0 2 dot 3 Ethernet standard communicates using unicast, broadcast, and multicast traffic. Duplex settings and LAN segmentation improved performance. Collision domains, broadcast domains, network latency, and LAN segmentation are key LAN design considerations.<br>-Switch forwarding methods influence LAN performance and latency. Memory buffering of network traffic allows the switch to store frames so that a switch can provide forwarding, symmetric, asymmetric, and multilayer switching features.<br>- Using the Cisco I O S C L I, you can quickly configure repetitive switch functions.<br>- An initial switch configuration consists of providing basic IP connectivity, host names and banners. Verify your configuration using the Cisco I O S show running config command, and always back up your switch configurations.<br>- Use the Cisco I O S C L I to password protect console and virtual terminal access.<br>- Implement passwords to limit access to privileged EXEC mode and configure system-wide password encryption.<br>- Use SSH for remote terminal configuration on Cisco switches.<br>- Enable port security to mitigate the risks and perform regular security analyses of network switches.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
