<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram compares two switch packet forwarding methods: store-and-forward switching and cut-through switching.<br><br>Switch Packet Forwarding Methods:<br>A store-and-forward switch receives the entire frame, computes the CRC, and checks the frame length and only forwards the frame if the CRC and frame length are valid. A cut-through switch forwards the frame before it is entirely received.<br><br>Store-and-Forward Switching animation:<br>Diagram: Two PC's and a server are connected to an Ethernet switch. The entire frame is read and the CRC checked before the frame is forwarded. <br><br>A store-and-forward switch receives the entire frame, computes the CRC, and checks the frame length. If the CRC and frame length are valid, the switch looks up the destination address, which determines the outgoing interface. The frame is then forwarded out the correct port.<br><br>Cut-through Switching animation:<br>Diagram: Two PC's and a server are connected to an Ethernet switch. The frame destination address is read and the frame is forwarded. <br><br>A cut-through switch forwards the frame before it is entirely received. At a minimum, the destination address of the frame must be read before the frame can be forwarded.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
