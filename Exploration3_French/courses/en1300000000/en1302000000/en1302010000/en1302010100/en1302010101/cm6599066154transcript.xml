<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts the operation of Media Access Control (MAC) in Ethernet using Carrier Sense Multiple Access Collision Detection (CSMA/CD).<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Four PC's, A, B, C, and D, are connected to an Ethernet bus type network cable.<br><br>Carrier Sense and Collision Detection Operation:<br>One. PC C listens before transmitting. It is monitoring the media for traffic.<br>Two. PC C detects (or senses) a carrier signal (digital sawtooth wave).<br>Three. PC C waits for a specified time after the signal passes. It will try again later.<br>Four. PC C listens again before transmitting. It is monitoring the media for traffic.<br>Five. PC C detects no carrier signal. The computer transmits.<br>Six. PC A and PC D listen before transmitting. They are monitoring the media for traffic. <br>Seven. No carrier signal is detected. Both computers transmit.<br>Eight. A collision occurs as a result of the signal from PC A and PC D.<br>Nine. PC A and PC D issue a jam signal.<br>Ten. PC A and PC D start a backoff timer and will try again later.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
