<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the three ways Ethernet communication occurs in a MAC address table.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Two PC's, PC1 and PC2, are connected to Ethernet switch S1. PC1 is connected to S1 Port 1. No PC is connected to S1 Port 2, and PC3 is connected to S1 Port 3.<br><br>Step One: The switch receives a frame destined for PC2 on Port 1 from PC1.<br>Step Two: The switch enters the source MAC address and the switch port that receives the frame into the MAC table.<br>MAC Table:<br>Port 1: MAC PC1.<br>Port 2: Empty.<br>Port 3: Empty.<br>Step Three: Because the destination address is a broadcast, the switch floods the frame to all ports, except the port on which it received the frame.<br>MAC Table:<br>Port 1: MAC PC1.<br>Port 2: Empty.<br>Port 3: Empty.<br>Step Four: The destination device (PC2) replies to the broadcast with a unicast frame addressed to PC1.<br>Step Five: The switch enters the source MAC address of PC2 and the port number of the switch port that received the frame into the MAC table. The destination address of the frame and its associated port is found in the MAC table.<br>MAC Table:<br>Port 1: MAC PC1.<br>Port 2: Empty.<br>Port 3: MAC PC2.<br>Step Six: The switch can now forward frames between source and destination devices without flooding, because it has entries in the MAC table that identify the associated ports.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
