<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the three ways Ethernet communication occurs in a switched LAN network: unicast, broadcast, and multicast. The format of the Ethernet frame and the MAC address are also presented.<br><br>Ethernet Communication:<br>Unicast: One sender and one receiver.<br>Broadcast: One sender to all other addresses.<br>Multicast: One sender to a group of addresses.<br><br>Ethernet Frame:<br>The diagram shows i e e e 8 0 2 dot 3 Ethernet frame format fields:<br>- Seven byte frame preamble<br>- One byte start of frame delimiter<br>- Six byte destination MAC address<br>- Six byte source MAC address<br>- Two byte frame length of encapsulated protocol type<br>- 46 to 1500 byte data (encapsulated packet) plus padding if required<br>- Four byte frame check sequence (CRC checksum)<br><br><br>MAC Address:<br>Diagram shows MAC address fields:<br>- Broadcast: The broadcast bit indicates to the receiving interface that the frame is destined for all or a group of end stations on the LAN segment.<br>- Local: The local bit indicates if the 24-bit vendor number can be modified locally.<br>- O U I number: The O U I number is 22 bits long. It is assigned by i e e e, and it identifies the manufacturer of the NIC.<br>- O U I: The O U I is 24 bits long and is made up of the broadcast, local, and O U I number fields.<br>- Vendor number (vendor assignment): The vendor assignment part of the MAC address is a 24 bit long number that uniquely identifies the Ethernet hardware.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
