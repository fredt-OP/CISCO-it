<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the two types of duplex settings used for communications on an Ethernet network: half duplex and full duplex.<br><br>Half Duplex (CSMA/CD):<br>Diagram: Four PC's connected to a hub. The hub connects to a switch.<br>- Unidirectional data flow.<br>- Higher potential for collision.<br>- Hub connectivity.<br><br>Full Duplex:<br>Diagram: One server connected to a switch, which connects to another switch.<br>- Point to point only.<br>- Attached to dedicated switched port.<br>- Requires full duplex support on both ends.<br>- Collision free.<br>- Collision-detect circuit disabled.]]></content-text></brief>
