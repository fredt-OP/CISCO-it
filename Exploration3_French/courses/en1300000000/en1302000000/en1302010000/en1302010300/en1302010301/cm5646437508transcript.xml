<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts LAN design considerations of controlling network latency and removing bottlenecks.<br><br>Controlling Network Latency:<br>Consider the latency caused by each device on the network.<br>- A core level switch supporting 48 ports, running at 1000 Megabits per second (Mbps) full duplex requires 96 Gigabits per second (Gbps) internal throughput if it is to maintain full wirespeed across all ports simultaneously.<br><br>Higher O S I layer devices can also increase latency on a network.<br>- A router must strip away the Layer 2 fields in a frame to interpret Layer 3 addressing information. The extra processing time causes latency.<br>- Balance the use of higher layer devices to reduce network latency with the need to prevent contention from broadcast traffic or the high collision rates.<br><br><br>Removing Network Bottlenecks:<br>LAN 1 has one switch, S2, with six PC's and one server attached. The server has one 1000 Mbps NIC installed and one connection to the switch. The NIC bandwidth for each PC to the server is 167 Mbps per computer.<br><br>LAN 2 has one switch, S2, with six PC's and one server attached. The server has five 1000 Mbps NIC's installed and five connections to the switch. The NIC bandwidth for each PC to the server is 833 Mbps per computer. <br>]]></content-text></brief>
