<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the concept of network latency. Each device in the path introduces latency.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Two PC's are connected to an Ethernet switch. A clock shows the elapsed time as the packet travels from one PC to the other through the switch.<br><br>One. The NIC places voltage pulses on the wire.<br>Two. The signal propagates through the cable.<br>Three. The signal traverses a network device (the switch).<br>Four. The destination NIC interprets the pulses.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
