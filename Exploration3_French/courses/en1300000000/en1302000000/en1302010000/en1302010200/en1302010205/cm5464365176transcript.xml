<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a comparison between collision domains and broadcast domains.<br><br>Uncontrolled Collision and Broadcast Domain:<br>Network Topology:<br>A central switch has four satellite hubs attached to it. Each satellite hub has four PC's attached to it. This represents four collision domains, but one large broadcast domain.<br><br>Controlled Collision and Broadcast Domain:<br>Network Topology:<br>Core router C1 has two distribution routers, R1 and R2, connected to it. Router R1 is connected to access switch S1 in LAN segment A. Switch S1 is connected to switches S2 and S3, each of which has PC's attached from building floors 1 and 2. Router R2 is connected to access switch S4 in LAN segment B. Switch S4 is connected to switches S5 and S6, each of which has PC's attached from building floors 3 and 4.<br><br>Broadcast Domain: Each router reduces the size of the broadcast domain on the LAN.<br>Collision Domain: Each switch reduces the size of the collision domain on the LAN to a single link.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
