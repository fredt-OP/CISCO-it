<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the switch boot sequence.<br><br>The boot sequence of a Cisco switch:<br><br>One. The switch loads the boot loader software from NV RAM.<br>Two. The boot loader:<br>- Performs low-level CPU initialization.<br>- Performs POST for the CPU subsystem.<br>- Initializes the flash file system on the system board.<br>- Loads a default operating system software image into memory and boots the switch.<br><br>Three. The operating system runs using the config dot text file that is stored in the switch flash memory. <br><br>The boot loader can help you recover from an operating system crash:<br>- Provides access into the switch if the operating system has problems serious enough that it cannot be used.<br>- Provides access to the files stored on flash before the operating system is loaded.<br>- Use the boot loader command line to perform recovery operations.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
