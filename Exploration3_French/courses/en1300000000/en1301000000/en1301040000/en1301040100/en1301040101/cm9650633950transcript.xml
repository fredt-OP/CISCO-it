<brief><content-text><![CDATA[In this chapter, you have learned: <br>- The hierarchical design model improves upon the limitation of flat, partial mesh, and mesh design models by improving the performance, scalability, availability, manageability, and maintainability of the network.<br>- Hierarchical network topologies facilitate network convergence by providing the performance necessary for voice and video data to be combined onto the existing data network.<br>- Traffic flow, user communities, data stores and server location, and topology diagram analysis can be performed to help identify network bottlenecks.<br>- The bottlenecks can then be addressed to improve the performance of the network and accurately determine appropriate hardware requirements to satisfy the desired performance of the network.<br>- Cisco switches combine specific form factors, performance, P o E, and Layer 3 features that support the levels of the hierarchical network design.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
