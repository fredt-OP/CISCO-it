<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts Power over Ethernet (P o E) and Layer 3 functionality.<br><br>Power over Ethernet<br>Shows an IP phone and a wireless access point (AP) connected to a P o E capable switch. The diagram shows the external power source connection of the IP phone and the P o E ports. Both the AP and IP phone receive power from the Ethernet cable. A wireless PC is communicating with the AP. From the AP, a diagram depicts the P o E ports, which look the same as any switch port. You should check the model of the wireless AP to determine if the port supports P o E.<br><br>Layer 3 Functions<br>Consists of three Access Layer switches called S1, S2, and S3. Each switch is connected to two Distribution Layer switches: D1 and D2. D1 and D2 are connected to Core Layer switch C1. A PC representing network 172.17.10.0/24 is connected to S1. Data center servers and a data store representing network 172.17.30.0 /24 are connected to S2. A PC representing network 172.17.20.0/24 is connected to S3.<br><br>Security polices on multilayer switch D1 at the Distribution Layer prevent network 172.17.10.0/24 on S1 from accessing the servers on S2 network 172.17.30.0/24. Security polices on multilayer switch D2 at the Distribution Layer allow access from network 172.17.20.0/24 on S3 to the servers on S2 network 172.17.30.0/24.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
