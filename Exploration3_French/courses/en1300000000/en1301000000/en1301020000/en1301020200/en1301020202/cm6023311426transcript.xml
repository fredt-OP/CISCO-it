<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts port density, forwarding rates, and link aggregation switch features.<br><br>Port Density<br>Title text: Port density is the number of ports available on a single switch.<br>Shows two fixed configuration switches, one with 24 ports and one with 48 ports. A modular switch is also shown with up to 1000 plus ports.<br><br><br>Forwarding Rates<br>Title text: Performance.<br>Shows two fixed configuration switches, one with 24 Gigabit ports that is capable of switching 24 Gigabits per second (Gbps) of traffic, and one with 48 Gigabit ports that is capable of switching 48 Gbps of traffic. <br><br>Link Aggregation<br> Title text: Performance.<br>Shows distribution switches D1 and D2 connected to core switch C1. Switch D1 is connected to C1 using four ports on both switches through multiple links, which aggregates ports for improved performance. Switch D2 is connected to C1 using a single port or link. The connection between D1 and C1 has four times the bandwidth as the connection between D2 and C1.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
