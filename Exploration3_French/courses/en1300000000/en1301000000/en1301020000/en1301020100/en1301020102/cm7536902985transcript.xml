<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts user community analysis, which is the process of identifying various groupings of users and their impact on network performance. Two groups of users are shown: the HR Department and the Finance Department.<br><br>Network Topology<br>There are three Access Layer switches: S1, S2, and S3. Each switch connects to two Distribution Layer switches, D1 and D2. D1 and D2 both connect to the Core Layer switch, C1. The HR Department users all connect to S1. The Finance Department users all connect to S3.<br><br>HR Department:<br>The HR department has 20 computers connected through switch S1, which has 24 ports. This access switch cannot accommodate the addition of 5 more computers! All the access switches have redundant uplinks to distribution level switches.<br><br>Finance Department:<br>The Finance Department has access to servers on switches S1 and S2. Finance users on switch S3 must go through more switches to get to a server on S1, which results in a larger diameter for the Finance Department. Finance users on switch S3 go through fewer switches to get to a server on S2, which results in a smaller diameter for the Finance Department. Finance computers are running financial software. If the Finance database is on the S1 server, more switches must be traversed. If the Finance database is on the S2 server, fewer switches are traversed.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
