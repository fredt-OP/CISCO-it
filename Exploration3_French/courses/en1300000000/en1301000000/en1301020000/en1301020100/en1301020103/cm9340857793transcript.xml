<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts data stores and data servers analysis and compares client-server communication with server-server communication. <br><br>Network Topology:<br>Consists of three Access Layer switches: S1, S2, and S3. Each switch is connected to two Distribution Layer switches: D1 and D2. D1 and D2 are connected to Core Layer switch C1.<br><br>Client-Server Communication: The client is connected to S1, and the server is connected to S2. Packets from the client computer travel through S1, D1, and S2 to get to the server.<br><br>Server-Server Communication: Two servers and a data store are connected to S2. Packets from server to server and server to data store go through S2 only.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
