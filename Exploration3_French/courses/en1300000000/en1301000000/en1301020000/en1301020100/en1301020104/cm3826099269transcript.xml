<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The topology diagram graphically represents a network infrastructure. It shows how all switches are interconnected, including the switch port that interconnects the devices. Redundant paths and aggregated ports between the switches are also shown.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Consists of three Access Layer switches called S1, S2, and S3. Each switch is connected to two Distribution layer switches: D1 and D2. D1 and D2 are connected to Core Layer switch C1. The switch ports that interconnect the switches are identified. For example, S1 port Gigabit 0/1 (G I 0/1) is connected to D1 port Gigabit 0/1 (G I 0/1), and S1 port Gigabit 0/2 (G I 0/2) is connected to D2 port Gigabit 0/3 (G I 0/3) for redundancy. <br><br>HR Department users are connected to S1. The data center servers and a data store are connected to S2. The Finance Department users are connected to S3. <br>]]></content-text></brief>
