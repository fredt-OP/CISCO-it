<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a three-layer hierarchical network model consisting of Access, Distribution, and Core layers.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Access Layer: Contains six access switches, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6. S1, S3, and S5 each have a printer and an IP phone connected to them. A PC connects to the IP phone. Rolling over the ACCESS button highlights all the components.<br><br>Distribution Layer: Contains four distribution switches, D1, D2, D3, and D4. Access Layer switch S1 is connected to D1. Switches S2 and S3 are connected to D2. Switches S4 and S5 are connected to D3, and S6 is connected to D4. Rolling over the DISTRIBUTION button highlights three V LAN areas as follows:<br>Faculty V LAN: D1, S1, and user devices. <br>Student V LAN: D2, S2, S3, and user devices.<br>Guest V LAN: D3, D4, S4, S5, S6, and user devices.<br><br>Core Layer: Contains two core switches, C1 and C2, and two routers, R1 and R2. C1 and C2 have two links between them for redundancy and bandwidth aggregation. C1 is connected to router R1, and C2 is connected to router R2. Distribution Layer switches D1 and D2 are connected to core switch C1. Distribution Layer switches D3 and D4 are connected to core switch C2. Rolling over the CORE button highlights switches C1 and C2 and routers R1 and R2. A WAN connection is established between R1 and R2 through a network cloud.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
