<brief><content-text><![CDATA[This image shows the benefits of a hierarchical network.<br><br>Scalability: Hierarchical networks can be expanded easily.<br>Redundancy: Redundancy at the core and distribution level ensure path availability.<br>Performance: Link aggregation between levels and high-performance core and distribution level switches allow for near wire-speed throughout the network.<br>Security: Port security at the access level and policies at the distribution level make the network more secure.<br>Manageability: Consistency between switches at each level makes management simpler.<br>Maintainability: The modularity of hierarchical design allows for the network to scale without becoming overly complicated.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
