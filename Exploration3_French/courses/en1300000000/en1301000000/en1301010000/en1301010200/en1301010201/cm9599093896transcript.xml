<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts three principles of hierarchical network design: network diameter, bandwidth aggregation, and redundancy. <br><br>Network Topology:<br>This is the same topology as Section 1.1.1, Diagram 1, but without the routers. Rollovers are provided with additional information for the three principles.<br><br>Network Diameter:<br>Diagram: Shows a path from switches S1 to D1 to C1 to C2 to D4 to S5, which is the maximum number of switches a packet would need to travel through to get from one end host to another.<br>Text: Network diameter is the number of switches in the path of traffic between two endpoints.<br><br>Bandwidth Aggregation:<br>Diagram: Shows parallel links between switches S1, D1, and C1 for bandwidth aggregation. Other sets of switches also have multiple links between them. This provides more bandwidth for high-traffic paths between the hierarchical layers.<br>Text: Bandwidth aggregation is normally implemented by combining several parallel links between two switches into one logical link. An oval encompassing several links is used in network diagrams to indicate link aggregation.<br><br>Redundant Links:<br>Diagram: Shows redundant links between S1 and D1 and between S1 and D2 to provide an alternate path in the event of a network failure. Other redundant links are also present between the Distribution Layer and Core Layer switches.<br>Text: Modern networks use redundant links between hierarchical network layers to ensure network availability.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
