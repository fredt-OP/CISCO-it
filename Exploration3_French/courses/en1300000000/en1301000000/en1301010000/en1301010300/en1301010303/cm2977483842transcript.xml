<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts an activity in which you must match the hierarchical layer label to the correct layer in the three-layer hierarchical design in the diagram. This is a similar topology to Section 1.1.1, Diagram 1, but with additional examples of device icons. Cable types and various devices are also identified in the activity. <br><br>Layer Labels:<br>A: Distribution<br>B: Core<br>C: Access<br><br>Network Areas:<br>One: End-user devices and Layer 2 switches.<br>Two: Intermediate multilayer switches to which the Layer 2 switches connect.<br>Three: Top layer multilayer switches that connect to the network cloud.<br><br>Supplemental device and cabling icon information.<br>Cable icons include a crossover, which is depicted by a dashed black line, a straight-through, which is depicted by a solid black line, and a WAN link, which is depicted by a red lightning bolt.<br><br>Devices and end-user icons include an access server, access switch, core multilayer switch, distribution multilayer switch, home office, teleworker, VPN gateway, and a wireless router.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
