<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts two scenarios representing non-hierarchical and hierarchical addressing. The scenarios use the same topology. Only the addressing scheme changes. <br><br>Switched LAN's at the Access Layer connect to a Distribution Layer router, which connects to a Core Layer router, which in turn connects to the network cloud.  <br><br>In the non-hierarchical addressing scheme, each network has non-related IP addresses, as follows:<br><br>Connection to cloud: 192.168.100.0<br>Core to Distribution Layer: 192.168.5.0<br>LAN 1: 192.168.1.0<br>LAN 2: 10.22.5.0<br>LAN 3: 172.16.8.0.<br><br>In the hierarchical addressing scheme, a logical grouping of networks exists, as follows:<br><br>Connection to cloud: 10.1.0.0 /16<br>Core to Distribution Layer: 10 .1 .1 .0 /24<br>LAN 1: 10 .1 .1 .32 /27<br>LAN 2: 10 .1 .1 .64 /27<br>LAN 3: 10 .1 .1 .96 /27.<br><br>Note that the subnet masks are now included in the addressing.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
