<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the use of VLSM to break up a subnet into smaller portions for use on serial links.<br><br>There are four routers, R1, R2, R3, and R4. <br>R1 is connected to R2 via Serial link (Subnet Address: 192.168.20.192 /30).<br>R2 is connected to R3 via Serial link (Subnet Address: 192.168.20.196 /30).<br>R3 is connected to R4 via Serial link (Subnet Address: 192.168.20.200 /30).<br><br>LAN network addresses<br>R1 network address: 192.168.20.0 /27.<br>R2 network address: 192.168.20.32 /27.<br>R3 network address: 192.168.20.64 /27.<br>R4 network address: 192.168.20.96 /27.<br><br>The following tables give a list of available subnets, and a list of Variable Length Subnets for the above network.<br> <br>Subnets of 192.168.20.0<br>Subnet Number: 0<br>Subnet Address: 192.168.20.0 /27<br>Subnet Number: 1<br>Subnet Address: 192.168.20.32 /27<br>Subnet Number: 2<br>Subnet Address: 192.168.20.64 /27<br>Subnet Number: 3<br>Subnet Address: 192.168.20.96 /27<br>Subnet Number: 4<br>Subnet Address: 192.168.20.128 /27<br>Subnet Number: 5<br>Subnet Address: 192.168.20.160 /27<br>Subnet Number: 6<br>Subnet Address: 192.168.20.192 /27<br>Subnet Number: 7<br>Subnet Address: 192.168.20.224 /27<br><br>Subnets of 192.168.20.192<br>Subnet Number: 0<br>Subnet Address: 192.168.20.192 /30<br>Subnet Number: 1<br>Subnet Address: 192.168.20.196 /30<br>Subnet Number: 2<br>Subnet Address: 192.168.20.200 /30<br>Subnet Number: 3<br>Subnet Address: 192.168.20.204 /30<br>Subnet Number: 4<br>Subnet Address: 192.168.20.208 /30<br>Subnet Number: 5<br>Subnet Address: 192.168.20.212 /30<br>Subnet Number: 6<br>Subnet Address: 192.168.20.216 /30<br>Subnet Number: 7<br>Subnet Address: 192.168.20.220 /30<br>]]></content-text></brief>
