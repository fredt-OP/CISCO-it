<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts three steps, which show how to apply VLSM to a network given the IP address 10.0.0.0 /8.<br><br>Step 1<br>10.0.0.0 /8 has been subnetted using the subnet mask /16.<br>There are five routers labeled R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5, which have been connected in a star topology.<br>R1 is in the middle of the topology and is connected to R2, R3, R4, and R5.<br>R2 network address: 10.1.0.0 /16<br>R3 network address: 10.2.0.0 /16<br>R4 network address: 10.3.0.0 /16<br>R5 network address: 10.4.0.0 /16<br><br>Step 2<br>Any of the /16 subnets can be subnetted further. In this example, 0.3.0.0 /16 has been subnetted using the /24 mask.<br><br>There are seven routers labeled R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, and R7. R1 through R5 appear the same as in the previous star topology.<br>There are three switches labeledS1, S2, and S3.<br>R4 is connected to S1.<br>S1 is connected to R6 and R7.<br>R6 is connected to S2.<br>R7 is connected to S3.<br><br>R2 network address: 10.1.0.0 /16<br>R3 network address: 10.2.0.0 /16<br>R4 network address: 10.3.0.0 /16<br>R6 network address: 10.3.1.0 /24<br>R7 network address: 10.3.2.0 /24<br>R5 network address: 10.4.0.0 /16<br><br>Step 3<br>In this example 10.3.2.0 /24 has been subnetted using the /28 mask.<br>There are eight routers labeled R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, and R8.<br>There are six switches labeled S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6.<br>R1 is connected to R2, R3, R4, and R5.<br>R4 is connected to S1.<br>S1 is connected to R6 and R7.<br>R6 is connected to S2.<br>R7 is connected to S3 and S4.<br>S4 is connected to R8.<br>R8 is connected to S5 and S6.<br><br>R2 network address: 10.1.0.0 /16<br>R3 network address: 10.2.0.0 /16<br>R4 network address: 10.3.0.0 /16<br>R6 network address: 10.3.1.0 /24<br>R7 network address: 10.3.2.0 /24<br>S3 network address: 10.3.2.16 /28<br>S4 network address: 10.3.2.32 /28<br>S5 network address: 10.3.2.48 /28<br>S6 network address: 10.3.2.64 /28<br>R5 network address: 10.4.0.0 /16<br>]]></content-text></brief>
