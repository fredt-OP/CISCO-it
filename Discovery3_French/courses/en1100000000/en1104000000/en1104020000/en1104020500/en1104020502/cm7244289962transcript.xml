<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts five steps that are used to calculate and apply a VLSM addressing scheme.<br><br>Step 1 <br>List the network requirements from largest to smallest.<br><br><br>Name/Required addresses: Atlanta HQ - 58.<br>Name/Required addresses: Perth HQ - 28.<br>Name/Required addresses: Sydney HQ - 10.<br>Name/Required addresses: Corpus HQ - 10.<br>Name/Required addresses: WAN 1 - 2.<br>Name/Required addresses: WAN 2 - 2.<br>Name/Required addresses: WAN 3 - 2.<br><br>The three point-to-point WAN links require two addresses each.<br><br><br>Step 2<br>The largest LAN, Atlanta HQ, requires 58 hosts. <br>Borrow 2 bits to use /26. This creates four subnets: <br>192.168.15.0<br>192.168.15.64<br>192.168.15.128<br>192.168.15.192<br><br>Name/Required addresses: Atlanta HQ - 58.<br>Subnet address: 192.168.15.0<br>Address range: .1 to .62<br>Broadcast address: .63<br>Network/Prefix: 192.168.15.0 /26<br><br>Name/Required addresses: Perth HQ - 28<br>Name/Required addresses: Sydney HQ - 10<br>Name/Required addresses: Corpus HQ - 10<br>Name/Required addresses: WAN 1 - 2<br>Name/Required addresses: WAN 2 - 2<br>Name/Required addresses: WAN 3 - 2<br><br>Step 3<br>Perth HQ LAN requires 28 host addresses.<br>Use the next available address of 192.168.15.64 /26<br>Borrow one more bit to create an address block of /27<br>This creates two subnets: <br>192.168.15.64<br>192.168.15.96<br><br>Use 192.168.15.64 /27 for Perth HQ.<br><br>Name/Required addresses: Atlanta HQ - 58.<br>Subnet address: 192.168.15.0<br>Address range: .1 to .62<br>Broadcast address: .63<br>Network/Prefix: 192.168.15.0 /26<br>Name/Required addresses: Perth HQ - 28.<br>Subnet address: 192.168.15.64<br>Address range: .65 to .94<br>Broadcast address: .95<br>Network/Prefix: 192.168.15.64 /27<br>Name/Required addresses: Sydney HQ - 10.<br>Name/Required addresses: Corpus HQ - 10.<br>Name/Required addresses: WAN 1 - 2.<br>Name/Required addresses: WAN 2 - 2.<br>Name/Required addresses: WAN 3 - 2.<br><br>Step 4<br>Sydney HQ and Corpus HQ LAN's require ten host addresses each.<br>Use the next available address of 192.168.15.96 /27<br>Borrow another bit to extend the mask to /28. <br>This creates two subnets: <br>192.168.15.96<br>192.168.15.112<br>Use both subnets, one for Sydney HQ, one for Corpus HQ.<br><br>Name/Required addresses: Atlanta HQ - 58.<br>Subnet address: 192.168.15.0<br>Address range: .1 to .62<br>Broadcast address: .63<br>Network/Prefix: 192.168.15.0 /26<br>Name/Required addresses: Perth HQ - 28.<br>Subnet address: 192.168.15.64<br>Address range: .65 to .94<br>Broadcast address: .95<br>Network/Prefix: 192.168.15.64 /27<br>Name/Required addresses: Sydney HQ - 10.<br>Subnet address: 192.168.15.96<br>Address range: .97 to .110<br>Broadcast address: .111<br>Network/Prefix: 192.168.15.96 /28<br>Name/Required addresses: Corpus HQ - 10.<br>Subnet address: 192.168.15.112<br>Address range: .113 to .126<br>Broadcast address: .127<br>Network/prefix: 192.168.15.112 /28<br>Name/Required addresses: WAN 1 - 2.<br>Name/Required addresses: WAN 2 - 2.<br>Name/Required addresses: WAN 3 - 2.<br><br>Step 5<br>Three point-to-point WAN links require two addresses each.<br>Use the next available address 192.168.15.128 /28<br>Borrow 2 more bits with a /30 mask.<br>This creates three subnets:<br>192.168.15.128<br>192.168.15.132<br>192.168.15.136<br>Use all three subnets, one for each WAN.<br><br>Name/Required addresses: Atlanta HQ - 58.<br>Subnet address: 192.168.15.0<br>Address range: .1 to .62<br>Broadcast address: .63<br>Network/Prefix: 192.168.15.0 /26<br>Name/Required addresses: Perth HQ - 28.<br>Subnet address: 192.168.15.64<br>Address range: .65 to .94<br>Broadcast address: .95<br>Network/Prefix: 192.168.15.64 /27<br>Name/Required addresses: Sydney HQ - 10.<br>Subnet address: 192.168.15.96<br>Address range: .97 to .110<br>Broadcast address: .111<br>Network/Prefix: 192.168.15.96 /28<br>Name/Required addresses: Corpus HQ - 10.<br>Subnet address: 192.168.15.112<br>Address range: .113 to .126<br>Broadcast address: .127<br>Network/Prefix: 192.168.15.112 /28<br>Name/Required addresses: WAN 1 - 2.<br>Subnet address: 192.168.15.128<br>Address range: .129 to .130<br>Broadcast address: .131<br>Network/Prefix: 192.168.15.128 /30<br>Name/Required addresses: WAN 2 - 2<br>Subnet Address: 192.168.15.132<br>Address range: .133 to .134<br>Broadcast address: .135<br>Network/Prefix: 192.168.15.132 /30<br>Name/Required addresses: WAN 3 - 2.<br>Subnet address: 192.168.15.136<br>Address range: .137 to .138.<br>Broadcast address: .139<br>Network/Prefix: 192.168.15.136 /30<br>]]></content-text></brief>
