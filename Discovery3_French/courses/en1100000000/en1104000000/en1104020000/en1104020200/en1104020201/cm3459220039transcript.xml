<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts the process of anding the IP address and Subnet Mask to determine whether the destination Host is on the same network, or a different network.<br><br>There are two hosts, H1 and H2, connected to a switch. H1 sends H2 a message. The switch checks to see if H2 is on the same network as H1. The network is determined by comparing the IP address to the Subnet Mask. H2 is on the same network, so the switch sends the message to H2. The IP Address, Subnet Mask, and Network Address for each configuration, as well as the corresponding binary equivalent, are listed below.<br><br>H1 Configuration<br> IP Address - 192.168.1.44, 11000000.10101000.00000001.00101100 <br>Subnet Mask - 255.255.255.0, 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000<br>Network - 192.168.1.0, 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000<br><br>H2 Configuration<br> IP Address - 192.168.1.66, 11000000.10101000.000000001.01000010<br>Subnet Mask - 255.255.255.0, 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 <br>Network 192.168.1.0, 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000000<br><br>The animation concludes by highlighting that both H1 and H2 are on the same network: 192.168.1.0.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
