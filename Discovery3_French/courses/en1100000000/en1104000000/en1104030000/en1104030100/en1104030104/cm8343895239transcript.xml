<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts an example of how a classless routing protocol is summarized when advertised to other networks.<br><br>Router, R1, is connected from its S 0 /0 /0 port via serial connection to S 0/ 0 /0 port of router, R2. The network address of the serial connection 172.16.3.0 /24. <br><br>R2 is connected from its S 0 /0 /1 port via serial connection to S0 /0 /1 port of router, R3. The network address of the serial connection is 192.168.1.0 /24.<br>R1 is connected via F A 0 / 0 to a switch on the network 172.16.1.0 /24. R1 connected via F A 0 /1 to another switch with the network address 172.16.2.0 /24. R2 is connected via F A 0 /0 to a switch on the network 172.16.0.0 /24. R3 is connected via F A 0 /0 to a switch on the network 10.1.0.0 /16. <br><br>R1 says I must advertise out my route information. R1 sends an update packet to all networks which it is directly connected to 172.16.1.0 /24, 172.16.2.0 /24 and 172.16.3.0 /24. <br><br>When R2 receives the update, it says I will summarize all routes from R1, and my 172.16.0.0 route, and will send it to R3. R2 sends a summary route to R3 with the 172.16.0.0 /22 information.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
