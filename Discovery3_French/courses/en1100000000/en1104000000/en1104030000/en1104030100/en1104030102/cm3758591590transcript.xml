<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts classful routing updates between two routers.<br><br>Router, R1, is connected from its S 0 /0 /0 port via serial connection to S 0 /0 /0 port of the router, R2. The network address of the serial connection 172.16.2.0 /24. <br><br>R2 is connected from its S 0 /0 / 1 port via serial connection to S 0 /0 / 1 port of the router, R3. The network address of the serial connection 192.168.1.0 /24.<br><br>R1 is connected via F A 0 /0 to a switch on the network 172.16.1.0 /24. R2 is connected via F A 0 /0 to a switch on the network 172.16.3.0 /24. R3 is connected via F A 0 /0 to a switch on the network 10.1.0.0 /16.  <br><br>When R1 sends an update to R2, R2 applies its serial 0 /0 /0 /24 mask to the 172.16.1.0 routing updates from R1.<br><br>When R2 sends an update to R3, R3 applies the classful /16 mask to the 172.16.0.0 routing update from R2.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
