<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts the effects of discontiguous networks.<br><br>Router, R1, is connected from its S 0 /0 port which is addressed 172.16.100.5 via serial connection to S 0 /0 port of router, R2. The network address of the serial connection is 172.16.100.4 /30. <br><br>R2 is connected from its S 0 /1 port via serial connection to S 0 /1 port of router, R3, which is addressed 172.16.100.10. The network address of the serial connection is 172.16.100.8 /30.<br><br>R1 is connected via F A 0 /1 to a switch on the network, 192.168.3.0 /26. <br>R2 is connected via F A 0 /0 to a switch on the network, 192.168.2.0 /24. <br>R3 is connected via F A 0 /0 to a switch on the network, 192.168.3.64 /26. <br>R3 is connected via F A 0 /1 to a switch on the network, 192.168.3.128 /26. <br><br>There is a host, H1, connected to the switch that is connected to R2. There is also a host  H2, connected to the switch that comes from the F A 0 /1 port of R3. Its address is 192.168.3.130.<br><br>R2 Routing Table<br>Gateway of last resort is not set.<br>172.16.0.0 /30 is subnetted, 2 subnets. <br>C: 172.16.100.8 is directly connected, Serial 0 /1. <br>C: 172.16.100.4 is directly connected, Serial 0 /0. <br>C: 192.168.2.0 /24 is directly connected, FastEthernet 0 /0. <br>R: 192.168.3.0 /24 [120 / 1] via 172.16.100.10, 00:00:05, Serial 0 /1<br>[120 / 1] via 172.16.100.5, 00:00:18, Serial 0 /0.<br><br>H1 says, I am sending a message to 192.168.3.130. H1 sends out its packets, which are propagated through the network and dropped at R1, but forwarded by R3 to H2 on the 192.168.3.128 /26 network.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
