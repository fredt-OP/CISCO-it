<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts an example of route summarization.<br><br>Router, R1, is associated with the networks 192.168.48.0 /24, 192.168.49.0 /24, 192.168.50.0 /24, and 192.168.51.0 /24. <br>Router, R2, is associated with the networks 192.168.52.0 /24, 192.168.53.0 /24, 192.168.54.0 /24, and 192.168.55.0 /24. <br>Router, R3, is associated with the network 192.168.56.0 /24 and 192.168.57.0 /24 to 192.168.63.0 /24.<br><br>When the networks associated with each router are advertised to the next hop router, one summarized network address is sent rather than multiple individual network addresses. R1 is connected to router R4 via a serial link with the network address 192.168.48.0 /22. R2 is connected to R4 via a serial link with the network address 192.168.52.0 /22. R3 is connected to R4 via a serial link with the network address 192.168.56.0 /21. R4 is connected to an ISP via serial connection with the network address of 192.168.48.0 /20.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
