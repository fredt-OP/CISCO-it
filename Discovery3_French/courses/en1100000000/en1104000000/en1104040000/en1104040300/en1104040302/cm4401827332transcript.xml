<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts sample configurations of two scenarios using Static NAT and the Dynamic NAT. <br><br>In the Static Nat scenario, a man is sitting at his desk in front of a computer. The man says, Static NAT maps a single private address to a specific public address." <br><br>In the dynamic NAT scenario, a man is sitting at his desk in front of a computer. The man says, Dynamic NAT maps multiple private addresses to multiple public addresses.<br><br>Static NAT output:<br>R1# show running-config<br>(*** output omitted ***)<br><br>IP nat inside source static 172.31.232.14 209.165.202.130<br><br>interface fastethernet 0 /0<br>IP address 172.31.252.182 255.255.225.0<br>IP nat inside<br><br>interface serial 0 /0 /0<br>IP address 209.165.202.1 255.255.255.0<br>IP nat outside<br><br>Dynamic NAT<br>R1# show running-config<br>(*** output omitted ***)<br><br>access-list 1 permit 172.31.232.0 0.0.0.255<br>IP nat pool pub - ADDR 209.165.202.131 209.165.202.140 netmask  255.225.255.0<br>IP nat inside source list 1 pool pub - ADDR<br><br>interface fastethernet 0 /0<br>IP address 172.31.202.182 255.255.255.0<br>IP nat inside<br><br>interface serial 0 /0 /0<br>IP address 209.165.202.1 255.255.255.0<br>IP nat outside<br>]]></content-text></brief>
