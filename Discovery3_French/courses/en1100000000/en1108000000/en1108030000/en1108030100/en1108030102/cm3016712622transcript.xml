<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts two scenarios that include a description and an example of Standard ACL Placement and Extended ACL Placement.<br><br>Four routers are directly connected in a circle by a serial link. Each of the routers, R1 through R4, has a FastEthernet port in use. The network addresses for each connected network are as follows:<br><br>R1: 192.168.1.0 /24<br>R2: 192.168.2.0 /24<br>R3: 192.168.3.0 /24<br>R4: 192.168.4.0 /24<br><br>Network Topology<br>R1 and R4 are opposite each other. There are blocks at R1 and R4 between the router and its FastEthernet port. These blocks indicate where an ACL may be placed. <br><br>Scenario 1: Standard ACL Placement<br>ACL<br>access-list 9 deny 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255<br>access-list 9 permit any<br><br>Requirements:<br>Prevents traffic from the 192.168.1.0 network from entering the 192.168.4.0 network. Allow 192.168.1.0 to reach other networks.<br><br>Bad Location:<br>Meets some of the requirements. Prevents traffic from 192.168.1.0 network from reaching networks 192.168.2.0 and 192.168.3.0.<br><br>Good Location:<br>Meets all requirements.<br><br>Scenario 2: Extended ACL Placement<br>ACL<br>access-list 109 deny IP 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.4.0 0.0.0.255<br>access-list 109 permit any any<br><br>Requirements:<br>Use extended ACL to prevent traffic from the 192.168.1.0 network from entering the 192.168.4.0 network, but allow the 192.168.1.0 network to reach other networks.<br><br>Good Location: Extended ACL is placed closest to source which prevents traffic from 192.168.1.0 network from reaching 192.168.4.0 but also allows it to reach other networks.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
