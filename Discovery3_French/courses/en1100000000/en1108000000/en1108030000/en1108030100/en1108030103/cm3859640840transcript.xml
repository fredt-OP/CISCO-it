<brief><content-text><![CDATA[This animation depicts the process of determining the type and placement of an ACL.<br><br>Network Topology<br>Router, R1, is connected to routers R2 and R3 via serial links. The following are the network address assignments for each router:<br><br>R1:  <br>F A 0 /1: 192.168.4.0 /24<br>F A 0 /0: 192.168.1.0 /24<br><br>R2:<br>F A 0 /0: 192.168.2.0 /24<br><br>R3:<br>F A 0 /0: 192.168.3.0 /24<br><br>The requirements given in the diagram are as follows:<br><br>"We need to prevent traffic from the 192.168.1.0 network from entering the 192.168.2.0 network but allow it to reach other networks." <br><br>The Standard ACL and Extended ACL commands are listed below:<br><br>Standard ACL<br>access-list 1 deny 192.168.1.0<br>access-list 1 permit any<br><br>Extended ACL<br>access-list 101 deny 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.2.0 0.0.0.255<br>access-list 101 permit IP any any<br><br>The following are questions included in the diagram.<br>One.What kind of ACL? Answer: Extended ACL.<br>Two.On which router? Answer: R1.<br>Three.On which interface? Answer: F A 0 /0.<br>Four.In which direction? Answer:  Inbound.<br><br>The extended ACL is placed on the interface F A 0/0 on R1 to control access to the 192.168.1.0 network.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
