<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts an activity in which you must match the correct router, interface, and direction for the placement of the ACL in each of the following two scenarios.<br><br>Scenario 1<br>Requirement:<br>You have an extended ACL that prevents traffic from the 172.16.1.0 network from reaching the 172.16.3.0 network, but allows it to reach 172.16.2.0 network and the ISP. You need to minimize traffic on the WAN links and can only place the ACL on one interface.<br><br>ACL<br>access-list 101 deny IP 172.16.1.0 0.0.0.255 172.16.3.0 0.0.0.255<br>access-list 101 permit IP any any<br><br>Scenario 2<br>Requirement:<br>You have a standard ACL that permits all traffic from any 172.16.0.0 network to reach the ISP network but blocks all other traffic.<br><br>ACL<br>access-list permit 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255<br><br>Network Topology<br>The diagram depicts three routers, R1, R2, and R3, that are directly connected by serial link to each other. The networks connected to the FastEthernet ports of each of the routers are listed below:<br><br>R1<br>F A 0 /0: 172.16.1.0 /24.<br>R2:<br>F A 0 /0: 172.16.2.0 /24.<br>R3<br>F A 0 /0: 172.16.3.0 /24.<br><br>The following are the router, interface, and direction options. Decide which ones belong to each scenario.<br><br>Option 1.S0/0/1<br>Option 2.R3<br>Option 3.S0/0/0<br>Option 4.R2<br>Option 5.S0/1/0<br>Option 6.OUT<br>Option 7.IN<br>Option 8.R1<br>Option 9.F A 0 /0<br>]]></content-text></brief>
