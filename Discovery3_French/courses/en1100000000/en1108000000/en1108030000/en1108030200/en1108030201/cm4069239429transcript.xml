<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the following guidelines for ACL Processing and Creation.<br><br>ACL Processing and Creation Guidelines<br>Configuring only one access list per protocol per direction.<br>Apply standard access lists closest to the destination.<br>Apply extended access lists closest to the source.<br>Use the correct number range for the type of list.<br>Determine the inbound or outbound direction looking at the port from inside the router.<br>Process statements sequentially from the top of the list to the bottom.<br>Deny packet if no match is found.<br>Enter the Access list statements in order from specific to general.<br>Configure an ACL with a permit statement or all traffic will be denied.<br><br>More Information Popup<br>Rejected packets cause an IP access list to send an ICMP host unreachable message to the sender and discards the packet.<br>Outbound filters do not affect traffic that originates from the local router.<br>An implicit deny any is at the end of all access lists (does not appear in the listing).<br>Create your ACL's in a text editor to make it easier to edit them. You can copy and paste ACL statements into the router.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
