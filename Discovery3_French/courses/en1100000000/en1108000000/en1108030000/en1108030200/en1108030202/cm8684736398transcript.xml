<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts an ACL configuration process.<br><br>Network Topology<br>Two routers, R1 and R2, are directly connected to each other via a serial link. R1 has its two FastEthernet ports in use. The network addresses assigned to these networks are 192.168.1.0 /24 and 192.168.2.0 /24. R2 has its two FastEthernet ports in use. The assigned network addresses for these networks are 192.168.3.0 /24 and 192.168.4.0 /24. There is a server connected with the address 192.168.3.200, and a client computer connected with the address 192.168.4.12. The ACL commands are listed below for the placement on R2 on FastEthernet F A 0 /0.<br><br>R2 (config) # access-list 3 remark to departmental server<br>R2 (config) # access-list 3 deny host 192.168.4.12<br>R2 (config) # access-list 3 permit 192.168.4.0 0.0.0.255<br>R2 (config) # access-list 3 permit 192.168.1.66<br><br>Note:  access-list 3 deny host 192.168.4.12 is specific.<br>access-list 3 permit 192.168.4.0 0.0.0.255 is general.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
