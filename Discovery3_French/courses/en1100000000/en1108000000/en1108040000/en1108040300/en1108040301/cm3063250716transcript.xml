<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts a conflict between NAT and an ACL statement that has been implemented. Users from outside the 10.1.0.0  /16 network have been given access to a server in an ACL statement, however NAT has blocked the traffic from entering the network.<br><br>ACL Statement<br>R1 (config) # access-list 101 permit 10.1.0.0 0.0.255.255 host 209.165.200.230<br>R1 (config) # interface S0/0/0<br>R1 (config-if) # IP access-group 101 out<br><br>Network Topology<br>There are two routers, R1 and R2.<br>R1 is connected to R2 via serial link, S0/0/0.<br>R1 has network 10.1.0.0 /16 attached on its F A 0 /0 interface.<br>R2 is connected to an ISP cloud containing a web server 209.165.200.230. <br><br>A packet from the 10.1.0.0 /16 network is sent to the server 209.165.200.230. When the packet reaches the S0/0/0 of R1, the NAT, enabled on R1, translates the source address from the private address of 10.1.0.0 /16 to a public address of 209.165.200.226. The ACL is unable to match this newly translated address, so the packet is denied. <br><br>The computer user in the diagram asks, "Why cant the users on the 10.1.0.0 network access the server?"]]></content-text></brief>
