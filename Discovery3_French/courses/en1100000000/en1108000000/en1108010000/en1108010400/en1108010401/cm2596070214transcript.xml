<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts the use of ACL's to limit traffic on a network. <br><br>Network Topology<br>There is a network cloud with two hosts, H1 and H2. The H1 IP address is 192.168.1.1. The H2 IP address is 192.168.1.5. There is a router, R1, attached to the cloud via S0/0/0. A switch, S1, is connected to R1 via S0/0/1. S1 is connected to two hosts, H3 and H4.<br><br>A packet is sent from H1 to R1 via S0/0/0.  R1 has an ACL on the inbound interface S0/0/0, as follows:<br>access-list 1 permit host 192.168.1.1<br>access-list 1 deny any (implied)<br><br>The IP address in the ACL statement matches the source IP in the packet so the packet is forwarded. <br><br>A packet is sent from H2 to R1 via S0/0/0. R1 has an ACL on the inbound interface S0/0/0, as follows:<br>access-list 1 permit host 192.168.1.1<br>access-list 1 deny any (implied)<br><br>This time the IP address in the ACL does not match the source IP in the packet. The packet is denied from being forwarded, receiving the Implicit Deny statement.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
