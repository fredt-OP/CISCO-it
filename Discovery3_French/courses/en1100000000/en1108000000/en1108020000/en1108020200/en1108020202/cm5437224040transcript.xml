<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a subnet mask chart with the following explanation.<br><br>Subnet address: 192.168.77.32 255.255.255.224.<br>Comparison/Base Address: 192.168.77.32 0.0.0.31.<br><br>Bit value, for one octet: 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1.<br>All 1s, for binary octet: 1, 1, 1, 1 1, 1, 1, and 1 gives a decimal value of 255.<br>Subnet Mask: 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, and 0 gives a decimal value of 224.<br>Wild-card Mask: 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1 gives a decimal value of 224.<br><br>Match Bits: First three bits of the above octet.<br>Non-Match Bits: Last five bits of the above octet.<br><br>More Information Popup<br>A network that is a full Class A, B, or C has a subnet mask and a wild-card mask that divide evenly at an octet boundary. Subnets that do not break on an octet boundary produce a different wild-card mask value. An octet boundary is a place between the first and second or second and third octet. Example: A default Class A subnet falls between bit positions 8 and 9. This breaks at the end of one octet and the beginning of the next is the boundary of the next octet.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
