<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the three layers of a hierarchical design model.  The Access Layer contains three switches. Connected to these switches are eight computers, five IP telephones, one server, and one network printer. The Distribution Layer consists of three routers, one switch, one web server, a DNS server, and an email server. The Core Layer has the high speed concentrator links to the internet cloud. Brief descriptions of the hierarchical design model layers are included, as follows:<br><br>Access Layer<br>Provides a connection point for end-user devices to the network<br>Allows multiple hosts to connect to other hosts through a network device such as a switch<br>Exists on the same logical network<br>Forwards traffic to other hosts on the same logical network<br>Passes traffic to the Distribution Layer for delivery if the message is destined for a host on another network<br><br>Distribution Layer<br>Provides a connection point for separate local networks<br>Controls the flow of information between local networks<br>Ensures that traffic between hosts on the same local network stays local<br>Passes on traffic that is destined for other networks<br>Filters incoming and outgoing traffic for security and traffic management purposes<br>Contains more powerful switches and routers than the Access Layer<br>Passes data to the Core Layer for delivery to a remote network if the local network is not directly connected<br><br>Core Layer<br>Provides a high-speed backbone layer with redundant (backup) connections <br>Transports large amounts of data between multiple end networks<br>Includes very powerful high-speed switches and routers<br>]]></content-text></brief>
