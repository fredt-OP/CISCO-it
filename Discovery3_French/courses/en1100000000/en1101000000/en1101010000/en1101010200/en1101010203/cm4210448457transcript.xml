<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The concept being communicated in this diagram is the impact of failure domains.<br><br>An edge router connects to the Internet and to two switches. Switch 1 has a small network attached. Switch 2 has one hub and one switch attached, with several computers connected to each.<br><br>If the router fails, the entire network fails.<br>If Switch 1 fails, only its attached network fails. <br>If Switch 2 fails, both of the attached networks fail.<br>If the hub or Switch 3 fails, only their individually attached networks fail.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
