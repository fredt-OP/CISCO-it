<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts each step in processing traffic using Q o S. The queue-ing  process is shown as data from different applications traveling toward an interface. <br><br>One.Classification - Data from different applications moving toward output router interface.<br>Two.Pre-Queue-ing - Data classified based on application, such as voice traffic, video traffic, FTP traffic, and so on. Red items represent unwanted traffic being filtered from the group.<br>Three.Queue-ing and Scheduling - Traffic is placed into queues based on pre-configured priority. Traffic in the higher priority queues, such as P 1 or P 2, is sent before lower priority traffic, such as P 5 or P 6. Example: Voice traffic does not tolerate delays, so it is placed into the highest priority queue and sent first. <br><br>Following the steps in the queue-ing process, the packets are sent one at a time, in order of priority.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
