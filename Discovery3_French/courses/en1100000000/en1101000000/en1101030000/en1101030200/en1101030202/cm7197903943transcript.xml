R1 is connected to the router (R2) over the Internet. R2 is connected to H4. H2 sends an unencrypted packet to H4. The packet travels via S1 to R1, where it is encrypted using IP Sec, and sent over the Internet to R2, where it is de-crypted and forwarded to H4.<br><br>More Information Popup<br>One of the most common encapsulation protocols for VPN's is IP Sec, which is short for IP Security.
