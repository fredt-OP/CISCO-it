<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts five routers in a cloud labeled Area 0.  Four routers within the cloud have individual networks connected to them.  R1 has network 192.168.0.0 /24 connected. R2 has network 192.168.1.0 /24. R3 has the network 192.168.2.0 /24. Router R4 has the network 192.168.3.0 /24. The ASBR router is connected to R1, R2, R3, and R4 via serial links that are all within Area 0. The ASBR router has a serial link to the ISP router, which is situated outside the cloud. The summary route for Area 0 is 192.168.0.0 /22. <br><br>More Information Popup<br>Inter-area route summarization is configured on Area Border Routers (ABR's) and applies to routes from within the A S. In order to take advantage of summarization. Network numbers in areas should be assigned in a contiguous way to be able to combine these addresses into one range. Summary routes between autonomous systems are configured on the Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR).<br>]]></content-text></brief>
