<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the merging of traffic between two organizations, A. and B, each on a network cloud, running two different routing protocols. Organization B has four routers as part of its network. Three of the routers have networks connected to the BR, which is the fourth router, via serial links. The routing protocol in use is RIP v2. The BR in B is directly connected to the ABR of Organization A.<br><br>Directly connected to ABR of Organization A. are four routers, each connected to their own networks. The cloud surrounding Organization A uses the OSPF routing protocol, sending OSPF updates out of the ABR to the BR in Organization B. <br><br>The BR in Organization B sends RIP updates to Organization A. The border routers BR and ABR are running both routing protocols RIP v2 and OSPF. This enables traffic to traverse across both networks.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
