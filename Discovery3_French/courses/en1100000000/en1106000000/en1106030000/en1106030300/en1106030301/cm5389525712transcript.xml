<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the advantages and disadvantages of using OSPF as a routing protocol.<br><br>Advantages<br>Uses bandwidth as a metric <br>Converges quickly using triggered updates<br>Limits routing loops through consistent view of network topology<br>Routing decisions based on latest information<br>Minimizes link-state database - fewer SPF calculations<br>Converges faster<br>Supports CIDR and VLSM<br>Designed hierarchically using areas<br><br>Disadvantages<br>Requires more memory and processor power<br>Requires more complex and expensive implementation<br>Requires an administrator who understands the protocol<br>Floods the network initially with LSA noticeably degrading network performance<br>]]></content-text></brief>
