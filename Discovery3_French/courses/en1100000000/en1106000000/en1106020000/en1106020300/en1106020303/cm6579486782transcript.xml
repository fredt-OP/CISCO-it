<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a network, identifying bandwidth and OSPF cost configuration commands.<br><br>The network topology consists of three routers, R1, R2, and R3.<br>R1 is connected to R2 via a serial link (R1: 192.168.10.1 /30 S0/0/0, R2: 192.168.10.2 S0/0/0)<br>R1 is connected to R3 via a serial link (R1: 192.168.10.5 /30 S0/0/1, R2: 192.168.10.6 S0/0/0)<br>R2 is connected to R3 via Serial link (R2: 192.168.10.9 S0/0/1, R3: 192.168.10.10 S0/0/1)<br>R1 has the network 172.16.1.16 /28 attached to F A 0 /0 (F A 0 /0 IP: 172.16.1.17)<br>R2 has the network 10.1 0.10.0 /24 attached to F A 0 /0 (F A 0 /0 IP: 10.1 0.10.1)<br>R3 has the network 172.16.1.32 /29 attached to F A 0 /0 (F A 0 /0 IP: 172.16.1.33 /29)<br>The bandwidth on the link between R1 and R2 is 64 kbps.<br>The bandwidth on the link between R1 and R3 is 256 kbps.<br>The bandwidth on the link between R2 and R3 is 128 kbps.<br><br>There are screen shots of R1 and R3, showing the bandwidth and OSPF cost command configurations used when calculating the OSPF cost metric. These commands are shown, as follows:<br><br>R1<br>R1 (config) # interface serial0/0/0<br>R1 (config-if) # bandwidth 64<br>R1 (config-if) # interface serial0/0/1<br>R1 (config-if) # bandwidth 256<br>R1 (config-if) # end<br><br>The bandwidth 64 is highlighted and there is a section at the bottom, which says "10 /64,000 bps = 1562"<br><br>R3<br>R3 (config) # interface serial0/0/0<br>R3 (config-if) # IP OSPF cost 1562<br>]]></content-text></brief>
