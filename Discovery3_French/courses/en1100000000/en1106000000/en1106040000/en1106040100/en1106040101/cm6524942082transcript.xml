<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Three Diagrams, Slider Graphic<br><br>Diagram 1, Image<br><br> The diagram depicts four areas encompassing the EIGRP router. <br><br>Diagram 1 text<br><br>OSPF is a classless interior link-state routing protocol used in enterprise networks.<br>OSPF offers scalability, route summarization, and isolates routing issues.<br>OSPF uses bandwidth to generate the cost metric.<br>OSPF routers within an area advertise information about the status of links to their neighbors using LSA.<br>OSPF routers use their router ID to elect a DR and BDR on multi-access networks.<br>An OSPF A S design starts with the backbone area or Area 0. Other areas created are all adjacent to Area 0.<br>An ABR connects an area to the backbone area.<br>An ASBR connects the entire OSPF A S to another A S.<br><br>Diagram 2, Image<br><br>The diagram depicts three routers interconnected via serial links. The OSPF packets from all three routers are encrypted to increase security. <br><br>Diagram 2 text<br><br>The OSPF network command uses a combination of network address and wildcard mask. It specifies the interface address or range of addresses enabled for OSPF.<br>To ensure the security of OSPF updates, configure authentication between routers. The most secure method of authentication is MD5.<br>A network administrator can dictate which routers become the DR and the BDR by setting the priority or router ID on the routers.<br>The bandwidth interface command and the IP OSPF cost interface command ensure that OSPF uses an actual cost to determine the best route.<br>Several show commands verify OSPF operation including show IP protocols, show IP OSPF, or show IP OSPF interface, show IP route and show IP OSPF neighbor.<br><br>Diagram 3, Image<br><br>The diagram depicts six routers connected in a pentagonal-shaped topology. <br><br>Diagram 3 text<br><br>An administrator configures a default route on an ASBR and then configures it to advertise the default route into the rest of the OSPF network.<br>Inter-area route summarization is configured on an ABR and applies to routes from within the A S. Summary routes between autonomous systems are configured on the ASBR.<br>OSPF requires more router memory and CPU resources which means more powerful and more expensive routers.<br>Route redistribution allows routes from one routing protocol or static routes to be imported into another routing protocol.<br>AD and longest prefix match determines the preferred route to a network.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
