<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts an activity in which you must use the following scenario to identify the path that packets will take when originating at H1, which is the LAN directly connected to R1, and destined for H2, which is the LAN directly connected to R5, while traversing in an OSPF network using the associated link cost.<br><br>Arrange four routers in order according to the Least Cost Path from first router to second router to third router to fourth router.  <br><br>The following is a description of the scenario:<br><br>Five routers are arranged in a pentagon type format where R1 is directly connected to all other routers, R2, R3, R4, R5, and is also connected to a LAN with host H1. <br>R1 is connected to R2 via an Ethernet link.<br>R1 is connected to R3 via an Ethernet link.<br>R1 is connected to R4 via an E1 link.<br>R1 is connected to R5 via a T1 link.<br>R2 is directly connected to R1 and R5.<br>R2 is connected to R1 via an Ethernet link.<br>R2 is connected to R5 via a T1 link.<br>R3 is directly connected to R1 and R4.<br>R3 is connected to R1 via an Ethernet link.<br>R3 is connected to R4 via a FastEthernet link.<br>R4 is directly connected to R3, R1, and R5.<br>R4 is connected to R3 via a FastEthernet link.<br>R4 is connected to R1 via an E1 link.<br>R5 is connected to R5 via an E1 link.<br>R5 is directly connected to R4, R1, R2, and is also connected to a LAN with host H2.<br>R5 is connected to R4 via an E1 link.<br>R5 is connected to R1 via a T1 link.<br>R5 is connected to R2 via a T1 link.<br><br>Included in this activity is a table listing the Interface Link Type and the associated OSPF cost.<br><br>Link Type and OSPF Cost.<br>Fast Ethernet = 1.<br>Ethernet = 10.<br>E1 = 48.<br>T1 = 64.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
