<brief><content-text><![CDATA[This animation depicts two scenarios of routers converging when using each type of routing protocol operation: Distance Vector and Link-State.<br><br>The physical topology includes four routers. R2 sits at the center of the network.  R1, R3, and R4 are directly connected to R2 via serial links.<br><br>Distance Vector<br>R1 decides to send a message regarding its routes from its routing table. The message passes to all R1 routes. Distance Vector protocols periodically pass the entire routing table. R2 receives the routing table information of R1 and sends a copy of an amended version of its own routing table to R1, R3, and R4. R3 forwards its routing table to all R3 routes and back to R2.<br><br>Link-State<br>R1 is notified that the link to 172.16.3.0 /24 is down. The Link-State protocol passes updates when a link changes state. The link update message of R1 is passed on to R2. R2 then makes amendments to its own routing table and forwards a copy of its routing table to R3 and R4. R3 forwards its routing table to all connected routes.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
