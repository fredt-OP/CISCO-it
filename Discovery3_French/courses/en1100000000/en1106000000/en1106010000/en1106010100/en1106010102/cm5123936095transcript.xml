<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts three routers connected in a triangular design with serial links between R1, R2, and R3. R1 has a directly connected network with the address 172.16.1.0 /24 represented by H1. R2 has a directly connected network with the address 172.16.1.0 /24, represented by H2. R1 and R2 are connected via a 56 kbps link. R2 and R3 are connected via a T1, 1.544 Mbps, link. The link between R1 and R3 is a T1, 1.544 Mbps, link.  <br><br>H1 sends a RIP packet out to R1. R1 then forwards the update to R2. The RIP update traverses the network until it reaches H2 connected to R2. RIP chooses the shortest path from H1 to H2 based on hop count. Next, H1 sends an OSPF packet out to R1. Instead of going to R2 this time, the packet goes to R3. Since the packet is using OSPF, the packet goes out of R1, to R3, then R2, and to the destination host of H2. It chooses this path to H2 because OSPF chooses the shortest path based on bandwidth. When comparing the OSPF and RIP packets, the animation shows the OSPF packet reaching the destination first, as it uses the fastest links to the intended host.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
