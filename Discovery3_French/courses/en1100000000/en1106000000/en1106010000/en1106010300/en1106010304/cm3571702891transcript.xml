<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts three examples of network topology, Broadcast Multi-Access, Point to Point, and Non-Broadcast Multi-Access. Each topology is described below:<br><br>Broadcast Multi-Access<br>A switch is at the center of four routers, which are directly connected to the switch. <br><br>Point-to-Point<br>Two routers labeled R1 and R2 are directly connected through a serial link from S0/0/0 on R1 and S0/0/0 on R2. Both routers have networks connected to their FastEthernet ports of F A 0 /0.<br><br>Non-Broadcast Multi-Access<br>The broadcast cloud lies at the center of four routers, which are directly connected to the broadcast cloud by serial links.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
