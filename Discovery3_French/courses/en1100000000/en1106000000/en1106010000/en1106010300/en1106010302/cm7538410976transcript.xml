<brief><content-text><![CDATA[This animation depicts the role of the designated router. A switch at the center of a star topology has five routers directly connected, labeled R1 through R5. R2 and R3 are also labeled DR and BDR, respectively. <br><br>R1 forms an adjacency with the DR and BDR only. R1 forwards all route information to the DR and BDR using an LSA. The DR (R2) and BDR (R3) receive the LSA from R1. The DR forwards LSA's containing the route information provided by R1 to all other routers. The DR (R2) sends out LSA to routers R3 (BDR), R4, R5, and R1.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
