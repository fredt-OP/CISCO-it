<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts how inverse ARP maps a Layer 2 DLCI to a remote IP address.<br><br>There is a frame relay cloud has two switches, S1 and S2, inside. There are two routers, R1 and R2. R1 is connected to S1 via Serial link on interface S0/0/0 I P:209.165.200.225 DLCI 16. R2 is connected to S2 via Serial link on interface S0/0/0 I P: 209.165.200.226 DLCI 20. S1 is connected to S2 by Frame Relay.<br><br>S1 states, "DLCI 16 is active." R1 sends a DLCI request to R2. R2 sends a response to R1 with its IP address information.<br><br>R1 states, "DLCI 16 is active. I will send an Inverse ARP request to learn the I P address of the remote router." The request is sent from R1 over the Frame Relay network to R2.<br><br>R2 states, "I have received an Inverse ARP request on DLCI 20 from 209.165.200.225." R2 references its Frame Relay Map that shows DLCI 20=209.165.200.225.<br><br>R2 states "Inverse ARP response from 209.165.200.226" and sends a response back to R1. R1 references its Frame Relay Map that shows DLCI 16 = 209.165.200.226.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
