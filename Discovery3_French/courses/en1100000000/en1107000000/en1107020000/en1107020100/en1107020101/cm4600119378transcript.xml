<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts how the frame format changes as it travels across the network.<br><br>The diagram depicts a man, labeled Source, sitting at one end of a network using an Ethernet connection.  <br><br>A woman, labeled Destination, is sitting at the other end of the network using an Ethernet connection. Network devices and connection types that make up the network are between the source and destination. Connected to the network is a server farm, a DMZ, and the ISP . <br><br>Protocols that may be in use during the transmission of the message from the source to the destination include HDLC, PPP, and ATM. As the message traverses the network, the frame format changes to accommodate the different protocols implemented within the networks the message travels through. The frame format begins from the source as Ethernet, then changes to formats HDLC, PPP, ATM, HDCL, PPP, and back to Ethernet at the destination.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
