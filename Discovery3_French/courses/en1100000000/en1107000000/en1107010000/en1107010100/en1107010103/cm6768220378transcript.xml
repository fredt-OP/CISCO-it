<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the Layer 1 WAN protocols and a brief description of each. In the diagram, a Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) interface to a WAN link is connected to the Data Communication Equipment (DCE) end of a service providers communication facility. The DCE is connected to the ISP . The following protocols may be used in a DTE and DCE connection.<br><br>EIA /T I A - 232<br>Allows signal speeds of up to 64 Kbps on a 25 pin D connector over short distances <br>Formerly known as RS-232 <br>Same as I T U-T V.24 specification<br><br>EIA /T I A - 449/530<br>Faster (up to 2 Mbps) version of EIA /T I A-232 <br>Uses a 36 pin D connector and is capable of longer cable runs <br>Also known as RS-422 and RS-423<br><br>EIA /T I A - 612/613<br>Provides access to services of up to 52 Mbps on a 60 pin D connector<br><br>V.35<br>An I T U-T standard for synchronous communications between a network access device and a packet network at speeds up to 48 Kbps <br>Uses a 34 pin rectangular connector<br><br>X.21<br>An I T U-T standard for synchronous digital communications <br>Uses a 15 pin D connector<br>]]></content-text></brief>
