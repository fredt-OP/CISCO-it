<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Diagram 1, Image<br><br>The diagram depicts enterprises connecting to a cloud and shows traffic from two virtual circuits share the same links.<br><br>Diagram 1 text<br><br>A WAN uses many different technologies, each offering distinct advantages. <br>Depending on the technology in use, converting the data format into an acceptable one requires a modem, or a CSU/DSU. <br>WAN technologies divide into circuit switching, packet switching, and cell switching. <br>Circuit switching technologies create a physical circuit between end devices before sending information. <br>Packet and cell switching technologies use either a PVC or SVC to send information across the network.<br>WAN technologies are either last mile, which connects the ISP to the customer, or long range which interconnects ISP's. <br><br>Diagram 2, Image<br><br>The diagram depicts two users communicating across a complex network topology.<br><br>Diagram 2 text<br>HDLC is the default Layer 2 serial line encapsulation on Cisco routers. <br>Cisco HDLC incorporates an extra field to allow it to carry multiple Layer 3 protocols. <br>The Layer 2 encapsulation changes as frames are moved across the WAN. <br>PPP allows the negotiation of many advanced features including authentication, load balancing, call back, and compression. <br>PPP supports both PAP and CHAP authentication. <br>PAP authentication sends the username/password in clear text and is subject to sniffing and replay attacks. <br>CHAP issues challenges at configurable intervals and forces the connected device to re-authenticate. <br><br>Diagram 3, Image<br><br>The diagram depicts the bottleneck when a branch office connects using a 56 kbps connection to connect via the frame relay cloud to the central site which is using a T1 connection. <br><br><br>Diagram 3 text<br>Frame Relay is a packet-switched technology. <br>Frame Relay uses virtual circuits to connect a specific source to a destination. Virtual circuits can be switched or permanent. <br>Use FECN's and BECN's to inform the receiving and sending devices that the network is congested so that routers can take appropriate actions. <br>Frame Relay uses parameters such as C I R to establish the bandwidth used on each VC. <br>]]></content-text></brief>
