<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Diagram 1, Image<br><br>The diagram depicts a static route topology.<br><br>Diagram 1 text<br>Enterprise networks are hierarchical in order to facilitate the flow of information.<br>Different topologies exist in enterprise networks including star, extended star, and mesh.<br>Networks use both static and dynamic routing to move information.<br>Static routes are manually configured and enhance network security and reduce the burden on routers.<br>Dynamic routes are learned and exchanged through routing protocols, and automate the tasks of providing the best route to a destination.<br>A default route forwards information that has no route in the routing table.<br><br>Diagram 2, Image<br><br>The diagram depicts hop count, and distance between routes.<br><br>Diagram 2 text<br><br>1.Dynamic routing protocols are classified as either distance vector or link state.<br>2.RIP is a distance vector routing protocol.<br>3.RIPv1 broadcasts the entire routing table to connected routers every 30 seconds.<br>4.RIP v2 multicasts its routing table.<br>5.RIP is very easy to configure and manage but does not scale well and is slow to converge.<br>6.Distance vector routing protocols are prone to the formation of routing loops.<br><br><br>Diagram 3, Image<br><br>The diagram depicts a list of E I G R P features.<br><br>Diagram 3 text<br><br>EIGRP is a Cisco proprietary distance vector routing protocol with many advanced features.<br>It is fast to converge and uses a composite metric for more reliable routing information<br>EIGRP multicasts only partial bounded updates using less bandwidth.<br>RIP v2 multicasts its routing table to 224.0.0.9 every 30 seconds.<br>Routing loops are prevented by using the DUAL algorithm.<br>EIGRP uses multiple packet types to maintain the neighbor, topology, and routing tables.<br>EIGRP maintains information on both successors and feasible successors allowing it to rapidly recover if a route goes down.<br><br>Diagram 4, Image<br><br>The diagram depicts an EIGRP network.<br><br><br>Diagram 4 text<br><br>EIGRP uses autonomous systems, which are process IDs.<br>EIGRP supports both equal and unequal cost load balancing.<br>EIGRP automatically summarizes routes; however this feature can be turned off, and instead done manually for better control of routing.<br>EIGRP is easy to configure but difficult to maintain and optimize.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
