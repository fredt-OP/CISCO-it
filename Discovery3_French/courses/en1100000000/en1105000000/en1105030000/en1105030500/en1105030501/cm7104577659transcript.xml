R1 is connected via S/0/0/0 with the address 172.16.3.1/30 to port S0/0/0 of R2 with the address 172.16.3.2 /30. R2 is connected to network 172.16.2.0 /24 via port F A 0 /0 with the address 172.16.2.1 /24. R2 is connected via port S0/0/1 with the address 192.168.10.9 /30 to S0/0/1 of R3 with the address 192.168.10.10 /30. R3 is connected to network 192.168.1.0 /24 via port F A 0 /0 with the address 192.168.1.1 /24. R3 is connected via S0/0/1 with the address 192.168.10.6 /30 to the S0/0/1 port of S1, with the address 192.168.10.5/30/ <br><br>R2 is connected to the ISP on the network 10.1.1.0 /30. <br><br>Highlighted in the console output from the show interfaces command is a line, BW 64 Kbit, for interface S0/0/0 and a line, BW 1544 Kbit, for interface S0/0/1. This depicts the difference in bandwidth, which is one of the metrics used by EIGRP to determine best path to a destination.<br><br>R1 # show int s0/0/0<br>Serial0/0/0 is up, line protocol is up<br>Hardware is Power QUICC Serial<br>Internet address is 172.16.3.1 30<br>MTU 1500 bytes, BW 64 K bit, DLY 20000 usec,<br>reliability 255 /255, tx load 1 /255, rx load 1 /255<br><br>R1 # show Int s0/0/1<br>Serial0/0/1 is up, line protocol is up<br>Hardware is Power QUICC Serial<br>Internet address is 192.168.10.5/30<br>MTU 1500 bytes, BW 1544 K bit, DLY 20000 usec,<br>reliability 255 /255, tx load 1/255, rx load 1 /255<br><br><br>The show IP protocols command displays information about the EIGRP routing protocol process.
