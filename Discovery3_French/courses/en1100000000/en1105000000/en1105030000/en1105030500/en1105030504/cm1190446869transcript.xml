<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts an activity in which you must examine the network diagram and answer questions about the feasible distance (FD), advertised distance (AD), and the successor route for specified routes.<br><br>The following is a description of the network. Network A is connected to R1 and has a cost of 1. Network B is connected to R2. R1 is connected to R2. R2 is connected to R4 and has a cost of 1. R3 is connected to R2 with a cost of 2. R3 is also connected to R4 with a cost of 2. R5 is connected to R4 with a cost of 1. R5 is also connected to R3 with a cost 2.<br><br>One.What is the feasible distance to network A from R5 via R3?<br>1, 2, 5, or 6<br>Two.What is the advertised distance to network A from R5 via R3?<br>1, 2, 3, or 4<br>Three.What is the feasible distance to network A from R5 via R4?<br>2, 3, 5, or 6<br>Four.What is the advertised distance to network A from R5 via R4?<br>2, 3, 5, or 6<br>Five.What is the successor router from R5 to get to network A?<br>Via R3 or Via R4<br>Six.What is the feasible distance to network B from R4 via R5?<br>1, 2, 5, or 6<br>]]></content-text></brief>
