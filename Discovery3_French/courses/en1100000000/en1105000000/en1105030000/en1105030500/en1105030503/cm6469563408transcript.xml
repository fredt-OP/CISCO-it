<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts R1 is connected to R2 with a serial link that has a cost of 10. R2 is connected to Network Z with a serial link, and has an AD of 5. R1 is also connected to R3 with a Fast Ethernet connection, with a cost of 14. R3 is connected to Network Z with a serial link, and has an AD of 6. Lastly R1 is connected to R4, with a serial link that has a cost of 10. R4 is connected to Network Z, with a serial link and has an AD of 5.<br><br>R1 EIGRP Topology Table<br>R2 is successor to Network Z, FD = 15, AD = 5.<br>R3 is feasible successor to Network Z, FD = 20, AD = 6.<br>R4 is successor to Network Z, FD = 15, AD = 5.<br><br>Feasible Distance (FD)<br>The minimum distance (metric) along a path from the router to a destination network.<br><br>Advertised Distance (AD) or Reported Distance (RD)<br>The distance (metric) towards a destination as advertised by an upstream neighbor. In italics: The neighbor routers distance.<br><br>More Information Popup<br>In an EIGRP routing table entry, the word via precedes the address of the successor. The feasible distance is the metric listed after the administrative distance of 90. In the entry below, the best path to the 192.168.1.0 /24 network is through the next-hop interface of the successor, 192.168.10.10, and that the feasible distance is 3014400: <br><br>D 192.168.1.0 /24 [90 /3014400] via 192.168.10.10, 00:00:31, Serial0/0/1<br>]]></content-text></brief>
