<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a router, R1, Ethernet network on interface F A 0/0. R1 is also connected via S0/0/0 to the S0/0/0 port of R2. R2 is connected via S0/0/1 to router the S0/0/1 port of R3. R3 Ethernet network is on interface F A 0/0.<br><br>Hello packets are sent at regular intervals between EIGRP neighbors to maintain adjacency. <br><br>R3 stops sending Hello packets to R2. R2 thinks, "My neighbor has not sent a hello for 15 seconds. My hold timer has expired." <br>When the timer expires, R2 thinks, "R3 must be down. R3 is no longer my neighbor. DUAL needs to recalculate routes I learned from R3."<br>]]></content-text></brief>
