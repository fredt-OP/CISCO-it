<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a static route configuration. A host, H1, with the address 192.168.1.5, is connected to a switch that is connected to router, R1. R1 is connected via its S0/0/0 port with the address 192.168.2.1 /24 to router, R2, with the address 192.168.2.2 /24. R2 is connected to a switch, which is then connected to host H2 on the address 192.168.3.8. The network between H1 and R1 is 192.168.1.0 /24, and the network between R2 and H2 is 192.168.3.0 /24. <br><br>The routing table for R1, when the static route is set as an Exit Interface Route, is as follows:<br><br>R	192.168.4.0 /24 [120 /1] via 192.168.2.2, 00:00:05, Serial0/0/0<br>C	192.168.1.0 /24 is directly connected, FastEthernet0 /0<br>C	192.168.2.0 /24 is directly connected, Serial0/0/0<br>S	192.168.3.0 /24 is directly connected, Serial0/0/0<br><br>In the animation, H1 sends a packet to H2. When the packet reaches R1, R1 searches its routing table. When it finds the static route within the routing table, S 192.168.3.0 /24 is directly connected to Serial0/0/0. It then knows what port the packet is to be sent out of and forwards it to H2 via that port.<br><br>The routing table for R1, when the static route is set as a Next Hop Interface Route, is as follows:<br><br>R	192.168.4.0 /24 [120 /1] via 192.168.2.2, 00:00:26, Serial0/0/0<br>C	192.168.1.0 /24 is directly connected, FastEthernet0 /0<br>C	192.168.2.0 /24 is directly connected, Serial0/0/0<br>S	192.168.3.0 /24 [1 /0] via 192.168.2.2<br><br>In the animation, H1 sends a packet to H2. When the packet reaches R1, R1 searches its routing table. When it finds the static route within the routing table, S 192.168.3.0 /24 [1 /0] via 192.168.2.2, it then recycles through the routing table until it finds which port is connected via the 192.168.2.0 network. <br>]]></content-text></brief>
