<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Four routers are connected in a ring. R1 is connected via 10.2 0.10.1 /30 to 10.2 0.10.2 /30 of R2. R2 is connected via 10.2 0.20.1 /30 to 10.2 0.20.2 /30 of R3. R3 is connected to R4. The network address for this connection is 1 0.20.40.0 /30. R3 is connected to the network cloud on the network 209.165.201.0 /27.<br><br>R1 routing table<br>R1 209.165.201.0/27 [120/2] via 10.2 0.30.2<br>R1 - Backup Floating Static Route<br>IP route 209.165.201.0 255.255.255.224 10.2 0.10.2 150<br><br>In the animation, R1 sends a packet to 209.165.201.0 /27 using the dynamic route within its routing table. The packet is routed via R4, and then to R3 before going on to the network cloud. The link between R1 and R4 then fails. The routing table of R1 is then updated with the backup floating static route. R1 sends another packet to 209.165.201.0 /27. It checks its routing table and sends the packet via R2, then onto R3 before going on to the network cloud. <br>]]></content-text></brief>
