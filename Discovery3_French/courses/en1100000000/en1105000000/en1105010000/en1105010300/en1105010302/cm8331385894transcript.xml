<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a host labeled H2 that is connected to a switch with the network address 172.16.1.0 /24. This switch is connected to the F A 0 /0 port of a router with the address 172.16.1.1 /24. <br><br>The router is connected via a serial connection from its port S0/0/1 with the address 172.16.2.2 /24 to the S0/0/0 port of router, R1, with the address 172.16.2.1 /24. R1 is then connected to a switch from its F A 0 /0 port with the address 172.16.3.1 /24. The switch is then connected to host, H1. <br><br>The first router is connected to a third router from its S0/0/0 port with the address 192.168.1.2 /24 to the third routers S0/0/1 port with the address 192.168.1.1 /24. This third router is connected to a switch on its F A 0 /0 port with the address 192.168.2.1 /24. The switch is connected to host, H3.<br><br>R1 # show IP route<br><output omitted><br>Gateway of last resort is not set<br><br>172.16.0.0/16 is subnetted, 3 subnets<br>R172.16.1.0 /24 [120 /1] via 172.16.2.2, 00:00:07, Serial0/0/0<br>C172.16.2.0 is directly connected, Serial0/0/0<br>C172.16.3.0 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/0<br>R192.168.1.0 /24 [120 /1] via 172.16.2.2, 00:00:07, Serial0/0/0<br>S192.168.2.0/14 [1 /0] via 172.16.2.2<br><br>Connected <br>C172.16.2.0 is directly connected, Serial0/0/0<br>C172.16.3.0 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/0<br><br>Static <br>S192.168.2.0 /14 [1 /0] via 172.16.2.2<br><br>Dynamic <br>R172.16.1.0 /24 [120 /1] via 172.16.2.2, 00:00:07, Serial0/0/0<br>R192.168.1.0 /24 [120 /1] via 172.16.2.2, 00:00:07, Serial0/0/0<br>]]></content-text></brief>
