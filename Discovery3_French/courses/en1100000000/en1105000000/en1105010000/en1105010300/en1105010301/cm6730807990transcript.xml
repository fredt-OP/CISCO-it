<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a small network. A host is connected to a switch with the network address of 192.168.1.0 /24. This switch is also connected to the F A 0 /0 interface of a router. The router is then connected to a second router via a serial link from its S0/0/0 port with the address 192.168.2.1 /24 to the S0/0/0 port of the second router, which has the address 192.168.2.2 /24. The second router is connected to two hosts via F A 0 /0 with the network address 192.168.3.0 /24, and F A 0/1 with the network address 192.168.4.0 /24. <br><br>When the show IP route command is entered on the first router, the following output is given:<br><br>R1 # show IP route<br>Codes: C - connected, S - static, I - IGRP, R - RIP, M - Mobile, B - BGP<br>D - EIGRP, EX - EIGRP external, O - OSPF, IA - OSPF inter-area<br>N1 - OSPF NSSA external type 1, N2 - OSPF NSSA external type 2<br>E1 - OSPF external type 1, E2 - OSPF external type 2<br>lower case I - I S-I S, lower case s u - I S-I S summary, L1 - I S-I S level-1, L2 - I S-I S level-2<br>lower case IA - I S-I S inter-area, * - candidate default, U - per-user static route<br>lower case o - ODR, P - periodic downloaded static route<br><br>Gateway of last resort is not set.<br><br>R192.168.4.0 /24 [120 /1] via 192.168.2.2, 0 0:0 0:2 6, Serial0/0/0.<br>C192.168.1.0 /24 is directly connected, FastEthernet0 /0.<br>C192.168.2.0 /24 is directly connected, Serial0/0/0.<br>S192.168.3.0 /24 [1 /0] via 192.168.2.2.<br><br>Routing Information Source<br>In the above output, the R in the first routing table entry is highlighted. This indicates how the route was learned. Routes might be directly connected, manually entered, or learned from a dynamic routing protocol.<br><br>Destination Network Address and Subnet Mask<br>In the above output, network address 192.168.4.0 /24 in the first routing table entry is highlighted. <br>This is the address and subnet mask of the destination network.<br><br>Next Hop<br>In the above output, IP address 192.168.2.2 in the fourth routing table entry is highlighted. <br>This is the address of the interface on the next router. The information forwarded to this interface moves closer to its final destination.<br><br>Exit Interface<br>In the above output, interface Serial0/0/0 in the first routing table entry is highlighted. <br>This is the exit interface on the router used to move information closer to the final destination.<br><br>Administrative Distance and Hop Count<br>In the above output, [120 /1] in the first routing table entry and [1 /0] in the fourth routing table entry are highlighted. <br>This is the administrative distance and metric associated with the route. The administrative distance represents the accuracy or trustworthiness of the metric used for cost calculations. The metric is the value used to calculate the cost to reach the destination.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
