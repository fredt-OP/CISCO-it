<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a table with the following routing information:<br><br>Configuration Complexity.<br>Static Routing: Increase with network size.<br>Dynamic Routing: Generally independent of the network size.<br><br>Topology Changes.<br>Static Routing: Administrator intervention required.<br>Dynamic Routing: Automatically adapts to topology changes.<br><br>Scaling.<br>Static Routing: Suitable for simple topologies.<br>Dynamic Routing: Suitable for simple and complex topologies.<br><br>Security.<br>Static Routing: More secure.<br>Dynamic Routing: Less secure.<br><br>Resource Usage.<br>Static Routing: No extra resources needs.<br>Dynamic Routing: User CPU, memory, link bandwidth.<br><br>Predictability.<br>Static Routing: Route to destination is always the same.<br>Dynamic Routing: Route depends on the current topology.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
