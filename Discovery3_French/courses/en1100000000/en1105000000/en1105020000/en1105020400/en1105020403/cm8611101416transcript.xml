<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts three routers labeled R1, R2, and R3 that are linked via serial link with network address 10.2.0.0. The second serial connection of R2 is linked to R3 by serial port with the network address 10.3.0.0. R1 F A 0 /0, with the network address 10.1.0.0, is connected to a LAN. The F A 0 /0 port of R3 has the network address 10.4.0.0 connected to a LAN. The routing tables for each router are listed below, with the following column head-ers: Network, Interface, and Hop.<br><br>R1 Routing Table<br>Network	Interface	Hop<br>10.1.0.0	F A 0 /0	0<br>10.2.9.9	S0/0/0		0<br>10.3.0.0	S0/0/0		1<br>10.4.0.0	S0/0/0		2<br><br>R2 Routing Table<br>Network	Interface	Hop<br>10.1.0.0	F A  0/0	1<br>10.2.9.9	S0/0/0		0<br>10.3.0.0	S0/0/0		0<br>10.4.0.0	S0/0/0		1<br><br>R3 Routing Table<br>Network	Interface	Hop<br>10.1.0.0	F A 0 /0	2<br>10.2.9.9	S0/0/0		1<br>10.3.0.0	S0/0/0		0<br>10.4.0.0	S0/0/0		0<br><br>Routing Loop<br>Network 10.4.0.0 goes down on R3<br>Before R3 can send updates to R2, R2 sends an update to R3.<br>R1 sends data packet to 10.4.0.0 network<br>Packet bounces between R2 and R3 because of incorrect routing table information<br><br><br>Count to Infinity<br>Network 10.4.0.0 goes down on R3<br>Before R3 can send updates to R3, R2 sends update to R3<br>R2 sends an update to R2<br>R2 sends and update to R1<br>R1 sends an update to R2<br>R2 sends an update to R3<br>R3 sends an update to R2<br>R2 sends an update to R1<br>R1 sends an update to R2<br>R2 sends an update to R3<br>R1 sends an update to R2<br>R2 sends an update to R1<br>R1 sends an update to R2<br>R2 sends an update to R3<br>R3 sends an update to R2<br>R2 sends an update to R1<br>Network 10.4.0.0 is unreachable, exceeds 16 hops <br>]]></content-text></brief>
