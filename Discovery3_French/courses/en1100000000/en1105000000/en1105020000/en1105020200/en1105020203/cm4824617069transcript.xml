<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts three routers labeled R1, R2, and R3. The routers are directly connected to each other through serial links. R1 has its Fast Ethernet port in use and configured with the network address 10.1.0.0.<br>The serial link between R1 and R2 is on the network address 10.2.0.0. The serial link between R2 and R3 is on the network address 10.3.0.0.  R3 has its fast Ethernet port in use and is assigned the network address 10.4.0.0. All three routers send requests out of all ports to all hosts connected on the network. The routers take note of the source I P address and the hop count metric used to get to the destination networks. On response to the request message, the router recalculates the hop count looking at the shortest path to the intended destination, and forwards based on that hop count to network required.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
