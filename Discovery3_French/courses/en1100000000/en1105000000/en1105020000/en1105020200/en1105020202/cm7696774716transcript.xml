<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a small network. Two routers are connected via serial link on network 192.168.2.0 /24. There is a network connected to F A 0 /0 of R1, with the network address 192.168.1.0. Two networks are also connected to F A 0 /0 and F A 0 /1 of R2, 192.168.3.0 and 192.168.4.0.<br><br>The diagram contains the console output of R1. Attention is drawn to the lines that show the two versions of RIP being used. One is multicast, RIP version 2, marked with three asterisks, ***. The other is broadcast, RIP version 1, marked with three number signs, # # #.<br><br>*** Aug 30 04:37:11:115: RIP sending V2 updates to 224.0.0.9 via FastEthernet 0/0 (192.168.1.1)<br>Aug 30 04:37:11:115: RIP: build update entries<br>Aug 30 04:37:11:115: 192.168.2.0 /24 via 0.0.0.0, metric 1, tag 0<br>Aug 30 04:37:11:115: 192.168.4.0 /24 via 0.0.0.0, metric 1, tag 0<br>R1 #<br><br># # # Aug 30 04:37:11:115: RIP: sending V1 update to 255.255.255.255 via Serial 0/0/0 (192.168.2.1)<br>Aug 30 04:37:11:115: RIP building update entries <br>Aug 30 04:37:11:115: network 192.168.1.0 metric 1<br>Aug 30 04:37:11:115: RIP: sending v2 update to 224.0.0.9 via Serial 0/0/0 (192.168.2.1)<br>]]></content-text></brief>
