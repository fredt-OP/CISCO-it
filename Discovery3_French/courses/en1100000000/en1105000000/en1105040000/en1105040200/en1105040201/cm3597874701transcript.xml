<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts three routers, R1, R2, and R3 in a triangular topology with serial links between all three router serial ports. The serial link between R1 and R2 is on network address 172.16.3.0 /30 at 64Kbps. The serial link between R1 and R3 is on network address 192.168.10.4 /30 at 1544Kbps. The serial link between R2 and R3 on network address 192.168.10.8 /30 at 1024Kbps. All three routers have networks connected to their FastEthernet ports and the network addresses for these networks are as follows, 172.16.1.0 /24, 172.16.2.0 /24 and 192.168.1.0 /24.<br><br>The show IP route command is issued and the corresponding output is displayed. The line with "Null0" is highlighted as an example of a summary route.<br><br>R1 # show IP route <br><output omitted><br> <br>Gateway of last resort is not set<br>192.168.10.0 /24 is variably subnetted 3 subnets and 2 masks<br>D 192.168.10.0 /24 is a summary, 0 0:4 5:0 9, Null0<br>C 192.168.10.4/30 is directly connected, Serial 0/0/0<br>S 192.168.10.8/30  [90 /3523840] via 192.168.10.6, 0 0:4 4:5 6, Serial 0/0/1<br>172.16.0.0/16 is variably subnetted, 4 subnets and 3 masks<br>D 172.16.0.0/16 is a summary, 0 0:4 6:1 0, Null0<br>C 172.16.1.0 /24 is directly connected, FastEthernet 0/0<br>D 172.16.2.0 /24 [90 /40514560] via 172.16.3.2, 0 0:4 5:0 9, Serial 0/0/0<br>C 172.16.3.0 /24 is directly connected to Serial 0/0/0<br>D 192.168.1.0 /24 [90 /2172416] via 192.168.10.6, 0 0:4 4:5 5, Serial 0/0/1<br>]]></content-text></brief>
