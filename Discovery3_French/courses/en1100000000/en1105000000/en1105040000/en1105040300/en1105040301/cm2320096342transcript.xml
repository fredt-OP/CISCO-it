<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts three routers, labeled R1, R2, and R3.They are configured in a triangular topology with serial links between all three router serial ports. The serial link between R1 and R2 uses the network address 172.16.3.0 /30. It is a 64 kbps link. The serial link between R1 and R3 is on network address 192.168.10.4 /30. It is a 1544 kbps link. The serial link between R2 and R3 uses the network address 192.168.10.8/30. It is a 1024 kbps link. <br><br>All three routers have networks connected to FastEthernet ports. The network addresses are as follows:<br>172.16.1.0 /24<br>172.16.2.0 /24<br>192.168.1.0 /24<br><br>The commands listed below will be available for output testing in future labs. Once EIGRP has been implemented, the commands listed below will reflect the addition of EIGRP.<br><br>***show IP protocols***<br><br>***show IP EIGRP topology***<br><br>***show IP route***<br><br>***show IP EIGRP interface detail***<br><br>***show IP EIGRP neighbors detail***<br><br>***show IP EIGRP traffic***<br>]]></content-text></brief>
