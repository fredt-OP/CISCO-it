<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a stack of switches labeled with various security measures. A brief description is given for each security measure.<br><br>Physical Security <br>Switches are a critical link in the network. Secure them physically by mounting them on a rack and installing the rack in a secure room. Limit access to authorized network staff.<br><br>Secure Passwords <br>Configure all passwords (user mode, privilege mode, and v t y access) with a minimum of six non-repeating characters. Change passwords on a regular basis. Never use words found in a dictionary. Use the enable secret command for privileged level password protection, since it uses advanced encryption techniques. Encrypt all passwords in the display of the running configuration file using the I O S command: service password-encryption. <br><br>Enable S S H for Secure Remote V T Y Access <br>S S H is a client server protocol used to log into another device over a network. It provides strong authentication and secure communication over insecure channels. SSH encrypts the entire login session, including password transmission.<br><br>Monitor Access and Traffic <br>Monitor all traffic passing through a switch to ensure that it complies with company policies. Additionally, record the MAC address of all devices connecting to a specific switch port and all login attempts on the switch. If the switch detects malicious traffic or unauthorized access, take action according to the security policy of the organization. <br><br>Disable http Access <br>Disable http access so that no-one enters the switch and modifies the configuration via the web. The command to disable http access is no ip http server. <br><br>Disable Unused Ports <br>Disable all unused ports on the switch to prevent unknown PCs or wireless access points from connecting to an available port on the switch. Accomplish this by issuing a shutdown command on the interface. <br><br>Enable Port Security <br>Port security restricts access to a switch port to a specific list of MAC addresses. Enter the MAC addresses manually or have the switch learn them dynamically. The specific switch port associates with the MAC addresses allowing only traffic from those devices. If a device with a different MAC address plugs into the port, the switch automatically disables the port. <br><br>Disable Telnet <br>A Telnet connection sends data over the public network in clear text. This includes usernames, passwords, and data. Disable Telnet access to all networking devices by not configuring a password for any V T Y sessions at login.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
