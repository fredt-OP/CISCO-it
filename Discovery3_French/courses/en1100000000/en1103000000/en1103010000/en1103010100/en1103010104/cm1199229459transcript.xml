<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the difference between a shared  segment that has hosts connected to a hub, and microsegmentation with hosts connected to a switch. <br> <br>In the shared segment scenario, the traffic on a shared segment is shown as a hub with eight hosts all sharing the same network media. All traffic is visible on the network segment.<br><br>In the microsegmentation scenario, the traffic on multiple paths is shown as a switch with eight hosts connected, utilizing four different network segments of two hosts each. The network segment has been divided, or segmented, creating four traffic paths within the switch. <br>]]></content-text></brief>
