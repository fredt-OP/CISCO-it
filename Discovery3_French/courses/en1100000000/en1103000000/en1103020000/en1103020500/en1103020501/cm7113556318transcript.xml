<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts the difference between Spanning Tree Protocol (S T P) and Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (R S T P) implementations.<br><br>In the S T P scenario, at first the light on the front of the switch is amber, indicating the switch is blocking. Next, the light begins blinking amber, indicating that the switch is listening/learning.  Finally, the blinking green light flashes and forwarding begins. The process takes approximately 50 seconds.<br><br>In the R S T P scenario, the time taken from the amber-blocking phase to the blinking green forwarding phase is one second.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
