<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts two problem scenarios that a unicast frame creates in a looped environment when multiple frames are transmitted or there is instability in the MAC database of a switch. The diagram depicts a server and two PCs, labeled H1 and H3, connected to a switch, S1. S1 is connected by dual links to the switch, S2. S2 is connected to a router, labeled R1, and to two PC's, labeled H2 and H4.<br><br>Multiple Frame Transmission<br>In the first scenario, the H2 client sends a message to S2. S2 says, I do not see the server in my MAC table. I will send this frame out all active ports. <br><br>S2 sends the message out to all connected devices, except the originating port. The dual links between S1 and S2 mean that the intended client receives two of the same message. This is known as Multiple Frame Transmission. <br><br>MAC Database Instability<br>In the second scenario, the server connected to S1 sends a message to client H4 on the other side of S2. S1 looks in its MAC table for the MAC address for client H4, but does not find an entry. Two messages propagate forward to S2 and back to the two clients connected to S1. S2 realizes the message is destined for the client H4 and says, I will update my MAC table with information for the originating server. S2 forwards the message to client H4.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
