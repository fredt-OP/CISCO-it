<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a Layer 2 switch with the switch port transitioning through the states of S T P. The states are listed below with a description of each state.<br><br>Blocking:  <br>Steady amber<br>Receive BPDU<br>Discard data frames<br>Does not learn addresses<br>Takes up to 20 seconds to change to listening state<br><br>Listening: <br>Blinking Amber<br>Listens for BPDU<br>Does not forward frames<br>Does learn MAC addresses<br>Determine if switch has more than one trunking port that might create a loop<br>If loop - returns to the blocking state<br>If no loops - returns to learning state<br>Takes 15 seconds to transition to learning state, also called forward delay<br><br>Learning:  <br>Blinking Amber<br>Processes BPDU<br>Learns MAC addresses from traffic received<br>Does not forward frames<br>Takes 15 seconds to transition to forwarding<br><br>Forwarding:  <br>Blinking Green <br>Processes BPDU<br>Learns MAC addresses<br>Forwards frames]]></content-text></brief>
