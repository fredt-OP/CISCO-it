<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a table of Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) Structure and the composition of the specific components of the BPDU. Information for each field is available.<br><br>Protocol Identifier:  Always 0<br>Version:  Always 0<br>Message Type: Identifies the type of BPDU (configuration or topology change notification) the frame contains<br>Flags: Used to handle changes in the topology<br>Root ID: <br>Contains the bridge ID of the root bridge<br>Contains the same value after convergence as all BPDU's in the bridged network<br><br>Root Path Cost: The cumulative cost of all links leading to the Root Bridge<br>Bridge ID: The B I D of the bridge that created the current BPDU<br>Port ID: <br>Contains a unique value for every port<br>Contains the value 0x8001 in Port 1 / 1, whereas Port 1 / 2 contains 0x8002, etcetera<br><br>Message Age: Records the time since the Root Bridge originally generated the information from which the current BPD  is derived<br>Max Age:  <br>Maximum time that a BPDU is saved<br>Influences the bridge table aging timer during the topology change notification process<br><br>Hello Time: Time between periodic configuration BPDU's  <br><br>Forward Delay: <br>The time spent in the Listening and Learning state <br>Influences timers during the topology change notification process<br>]]></content-text></brief>
