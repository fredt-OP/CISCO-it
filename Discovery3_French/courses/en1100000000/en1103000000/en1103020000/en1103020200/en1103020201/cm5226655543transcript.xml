<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the difference between using and not using S T P. Four switches arranged in a square topology with computers connected to two of the switches. There are dual links between the four switches, indicating the flow of data from switch 1 to switch 2 to switch 3, and then switch 4. <br><br>No S T P<br>When the configuration has no S T P in use, the switching loop is evident. <br><br>With S T P<br>When S T P is implemented, the link between two switches is blocked by removing access to the port. The link ceases to exist, thereby eliminating the loop.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
