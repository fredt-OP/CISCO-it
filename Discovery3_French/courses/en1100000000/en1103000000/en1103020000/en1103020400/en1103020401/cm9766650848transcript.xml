<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts the recalculation of spanning tree. Four switches are connected in a square topology arrangement with a client connected to one switch, we will call Switch 1, and a server connected to another switch, we will call Switch 3. The server sends a message to the client, H1, which passes through three of the switches to get to H1. The message reaches H1. The link between Switch 2 and Switch 3 goes down. Now all four switches become busy recalculating the STP. <br><br>The server tries to send another message, and the switch that it is directly connected to the server, Switch 3, announces, "I need a new root port." Switch 4 announces, "My blocked port is now ready to forward traffic." Switch 1 announces, "My root port remains the same." Switch 2 is assigned as the Root Bridge and announces, "I can still see connectivity to all the switches." <br><br>The server that is directly connected to Switch 3 sends a message and it travels from Switch 3 to Switch 4 to Switch 1 and then to the client H1, this time bypassing the broken link through Switch 2.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
