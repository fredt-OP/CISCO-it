<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Enterprise networks rely on switches in the Access, Distribution, and Core Layers to provide network segmentation and high-speed connectivity. <br><br>Spanning Tree Protocol is used in a hierarchical network to prevent switching loops. <br><br>Virtual LAN's logically segment networks and contain broadcasts to improve network security and performance. <br><br>Switches configured with trunking enable V LAN's to span multiple geographic locations. <br><br>Virtual Trunking Protocol is used to simplify the configuration and management of V LAN's in a complex enterprise level switched network. <br><br>After completion of this chapter, you should be able to:<br>Compare the types of switches used in an enterprise network.<br>Explain how Spanning Tree Protocol prevents switching loops.<br>Describe and configure V LAN's on a Cisco switch.<br>Describe and configure trunking and Inter-V LAN routing.<br>Maintain V LAN's in an enterprise network.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
