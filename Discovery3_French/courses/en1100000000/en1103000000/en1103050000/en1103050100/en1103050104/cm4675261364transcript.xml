I must request more information.<br>The Client then sends an Advertisement Request back to the Server.  <br><br>The Server notes, I received an advertisement request, I will send more information.  <br>The Server then sends a Subset Advertisement of V LANs = 1,2,3 to the Client.  <br><br>The Client notes, I have updated my V LAN information and configuration revision number.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
