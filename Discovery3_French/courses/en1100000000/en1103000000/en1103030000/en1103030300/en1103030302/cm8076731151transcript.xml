<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the insertion of a 802.1q tag into a frame. After the insertion the frame receives a new FCS value. A brief description of the fields is given. <br><br>T P I D <br>The Tag Protocol Identifier is a 16-bit field.<br>It is set to a value of 0x8100 in order to identify the frame as an IEEE 802.1 Q tagged frame. <br><br>PRIORITY <br>It is known as user priority. <br>This 3-bit field refers to the IEEE 802.1Q priority. <br>The field indicates the frame priority level used for the prioritization of traffic. <br>The field can represent 8 levels (0 through 7). <br><br>C F ID <br>The Canonical Format Indicator is a 1-bit field.<br>If the value of this field is 1, the MAC address is in no canonical format. <br>If the value is 0, the MAC address is in canonical format. <br><br>V ID <br>The V LAN Identifier is a 12-bit field.<br>It uniquely identifies the V LAN to which the frame belongs. <br>The field has a value between 0 and 4095. <br>]]></content-text></brief>
