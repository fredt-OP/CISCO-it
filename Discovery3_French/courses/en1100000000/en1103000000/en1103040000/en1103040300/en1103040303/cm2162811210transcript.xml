<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts inter-V LAN routing. A subinterface is used to establish communication between multiple V LANs. There are three V LAN's, V LAN 1, V LAN 15, and V LAN 35, each represented by a different colored circle. All three V LAN's connect to the Router via a single link (subinterface). The link has been divided up into three logical pathways (one per V LAN). <br><br>Network<br>One Router (R1).<br>One Switch (S1).<br>R1 is connected to S1 via a single link, F A 0 / 0, using three subinterfaces: <br>F A 0 / 0.1 for V LAN 1, F A 0 / 0.15 for V LAN 15, and F A 0/0.35 for V LAN 35.<br>S1 has three V LAN's (V LAN 1, V LAN 15, V LAN 35).<br>V LAN 1  has one Host<br>V LAN 15 has two Hosts<br>V LAN 35 has one Host<br>]]></content-text></brief>
