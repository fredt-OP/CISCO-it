As each V LAN has its own link from S1 to S2 the information is sent on the corresponding V LAN's link from S1 to S2.<br><br>Trunking<br>Two Switches (S1, S2).<br>Three V LAN's (V LAN 1, V LAN 2, V LAN 3).<br>Six Hosts (H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6).<br>V LAN 1 has H5, H3.<br>V LAN 2 has H6, H2.<br>V LAN 3 has H1, H4.<br>S1 is connected to S2 via trunk (All V LAN's share a link.).<br>S1 has H1, H5, H6 connected.<br>S2 has H2, H3, H4 connected.<br><br>H5 (V LAN 1), H6 (V LAN 2, H1 (V LAN 3) send information to H 3 (V LAN 1), H2 (V LAN 2), H4 (V LAN 3).
