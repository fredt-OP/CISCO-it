<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts an activity in which you must determine how many hosts will be unable to connect to the Internet when each router fails. <br><br>Network Topology<br>The Internet connects to router, R1, which connects to router, R2. R2 connects to routers, R3 and R5. R3 connects to two switches. Each switch connects to two hosts. R3 also connects back to router, R5. R5 connects to routers, R4 and R6. R4 connects to three switches. R6 connects to three switches. R4 and R6 each connect to three switches. Each switch is connected to two hosts.<br><br>Outcome when each router fails.<br>R1: Number of hosts unable to connect? (2, 4, 6, 10, 12, or 16.)<br>R2: Number of hosts unable to connect? (2, 4, 6, 10, 12, or 16.)<br>R3: Number of hosts unable to connect? (2, 4, 6, 10, 12, or 16.) <br>R4: Number of hosts unable to connect? (2, 4, 6, 10, 12, or 16.) <br>R5: Number of hosts unable to connect? (2, 4, 6, 10, 12, or 16.) <br>R6: Number of hosts unable to connect? (2, 4, 6, 10, 12, or 16.) <br>]]></content-text></brief>
