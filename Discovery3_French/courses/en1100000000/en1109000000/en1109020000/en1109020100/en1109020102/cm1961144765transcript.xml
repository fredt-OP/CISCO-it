<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a topology with a switch that fails.<br><br>Network Topology<br>Two switches, S1 and S2, are directly connected to each other by an Ethernet link from F A 0 /2 on both switches. S1 has F A 0 /4 and F A 0 /6 in use. S2 has its F A 0 /1 port in use. An Ethernet link between S2 and R1 has been established. R1 has a serial link to the WAN cloud.<br><br>The command "show mac-address-table" has been issued. The following is the output. The table headers include the following: V LAN, MAC Address, Type, and Ports.<br><br>S1# show mac-address-table<br>MAC Address Table<br><br>V LAN MAC AddressTypePorts<br><br>All000.d.6563.bd00StaticCPU<br>All0100.0ccc.ccccStaticCPU<br>All0100.0ccc.cccdStaticCPU<br>All 0100.0ccc.ddddStaticCPU<br>1000d.29a0.88e0DynamicFA0/2<br>1000d.6563.0582DynamicFA0/2<br>10010.a4fa.b23eDynamic F A 0 /6<br>100b0.d04d.01f7Dynamic F A 0 /4<br>101000d.29a0.88e0Dynamic F A 0 /2<br>101000d.6563.0582Dynamic F A 0 /2<br>102000d.29a0.88e0Dynamic F A 0 /2<br>102000d.6563.0582Dynamic F A 0 /2<br>103000d.29a0.88e0Dynamic F A 0 /2<br>103000d.6563,0582Dynamic F A 0 /2<br>Total MAC addresses in this criterion:  14 <br>]]></content-text></brief>
