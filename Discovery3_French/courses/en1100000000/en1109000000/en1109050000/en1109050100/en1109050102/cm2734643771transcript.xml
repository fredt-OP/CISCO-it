<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the output when examining an ACL on a network. The following commands are used: R1# show running-config, R1# debug IP packet, R1# show IP interface, and R1# show access-lists.<br><br>Network Topology<br>Two hosts are connected to a switch. The two hosts have the IP addresses 192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.3, and are part of the 192.168.1.0 /24 network. A switch is connected to the router, R1 F A 0 /0. This interface has an ACL applied (ACL 123 inbound). R1 S0/0/0 is connected to the S0/0/0 of router, R2, with a network address of 172.20.0.1 /30. R2 F A 0 /0 is connected to another switch on the 192.168.2.0 /24 network. A server is connected to the switch with an IP address of 192.168.2.2. <br><br>Output<br>R1 # show running-config<br>IP address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0<br>IP access-group 123 in<br>[output omitted]<br>access-list 123 deny tcp host 192.168.1.2. host 192.168.2.2 eq telnet<br>access-list 123 permit IP 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any<br><br>R1 # debug IP packet<br>*Sep 19 ...omitted...
