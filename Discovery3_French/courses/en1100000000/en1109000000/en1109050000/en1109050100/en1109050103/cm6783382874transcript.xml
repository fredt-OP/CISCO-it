<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts an activity in which you must analyze the network topology and router command output. Indicate whether the statements regarding ACL's and their effects are True or False.<br><br>Network Topology<br>The diagram depicts two hosts connected to a switch. The two hosts have the IP addresses 192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.3, and are part of the 192.168.1.0 /24 network. The switch is connected to the router, R1, via F A 0 /0. This interface has an ACL applied (ACL 123 inbound). R1 S0/0/0 is connected to router, R2, with a network address of 172.20.0.1 /30. R2 F A 0 /0 is connected to another switch on the 192.168.2.0 /24 network.  A server is connected to the switch with an IP address of 192.168.2.2.<br><br>Scenario 1<br>The following is the router output for the command show running-config.<br><br>R1# show running-config<br>Building Configuration...<br>(**output omitted**)<br><br>hostname R1<br><br>interface Fast Ethernet 0 /0<br>   description LAN gateway for 192.168.1.0 net<br>   IP address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0<br>   IP access-group 123 in<br>   duplex auto<br>   speed auto<br><br>interface FastEthernet 0 /1<br>   no IP address<br>   shutdown<br>   duplex auto <br>   speed auto<br><br>interface Serial0/0/0<br>   description WAN link to R2<br>   IP address 172.20.1.1 255.255.255.252<br>   no fair-queue<br><br>   interface Serial0/0/1<br>   no IP address<br>   shutdown<br><br>router rip<br>   version 2<br>   passive-interface FastEthernet 0/0<br>   network 172.20.0.0<br>   network 192.168.1.0<br>   no auto-summary<br><br>access-list 123 permit tcp host 192.168.1.2 any eq telnet<br>access-list 123 permit tcp host 192.168.1.2 any range ftp-data ftp<br>access-list 123 deny tcp any any eq telnet<br>access-list 123 tcp any any range ftp-data ftp<br>access-list 123 permit IP 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any<br>access-list 123 deny IP any any<br><br>Determine if the statements below are True or False.<br>One.This router is configured with a standard ACL.<br>Two.If a telnet packet from 192.168.1.5 enters F A 0 /0 it will be permitted.<br>Three.Host 192.168.1.2 is permitted to transfer files to and from any FTP server.<br>Four.This ACL is applied to F A 0 /0 inbound.<br>Five.If an HTTP packet from a host on network 192.168.1.0 is received on F A 0 /0 inbound it will permitted.<br> <br>Scenario 2<br><br>The following is the router output for the command show access-list.<br>R1 # show access-list <br>Extended IP access-list 123<br>   permit tcp host 192.168.1.2 any eq telnet (24 matches)<br>   permit tcp host 192.168.1.2 any range ftp-data ftp<br>   deny tcp any any eq telnet (8 matches)<br>   deny tcp any any range ftp-data ftp (12 matches)<br>   permit IP 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any (250 matches)<br>   deny IP any any (22 matches)<br><br>Determine if the statements below are True or False.<br>One.This router ACL allows an administrator PC (192.168.1.2) to Telnet and FTP to any location.<br>Two.The administrator has been using FTP extensively.<br>Three.PC's other than 192.168.1.2 on the 192.168.1.0 network have attempted to telnet to other networks.<br>Four.This ACL prevents transferring a file using using FTP from PC 192.168.1.3 to PC 192.168.1.5<br>Five.Most hosts have used IP protocols other than FTP and Telnet (e.g. HTTP) to connect to other networks.<br><br>Scenario 3<br>The following is the router output for the command debug IP packet.<br><br>R1# debug IP packet <br>IP packet debugging is on<br>R1#<br>*Sep 19 17:09:25.555: IP: s=192.168.1.3 (FastEthernet 0 /0),d=192.168.2.2, len 48, access denied<br>*Sep 19 17:09:26.555: IP: tableid=0, s=192.168.1.1 (local),d=192.168.1.3 (FastEthernet 0 /0) routed via FIB<br>*Sep 19 17:11:34:555: IP:  s=172.20.1.2 (Serial 0/0/0),<br>d= 224.0.0.9, len 52, recvd 2<br>*Sep 19 17:11:45.119: IP: s=172.20.1.1 (local), d=224.0.0.9 <br>(Serial0/0/0), len 52, sending broadcast/multicast<br>R1#<br>*Sep 19 17:09:25.555: IP: s=192.168.1.5 (FastEthernet 0/0),d=192.168.2.2, len 48, access denied<br>*Sep 19 17:09:26.555: IP: tableid=0, s=192.168.1.1 (local, d=192.168.1.5 (FastEthernet 0 /0) routed via FIB<br><br>Determine if the statements below are True or False.<br>One.All packets from host 192.168.1.5 have been permitted by this router and ACL.<br>Two.This router is running only the EIGRP routing protocol.<br>Three.Packets from host 192.168.1.3 may be permitted by this router and ACL depending on the protocol they are using.<br>Four.Routing updates to multicast addresses 224.0.0.9 are being blocked by the ACL on this router.<br>Five.The IP address of the S0/0/0 interface on this router is 172.20.1.2<br>]]></content-text></brief>
