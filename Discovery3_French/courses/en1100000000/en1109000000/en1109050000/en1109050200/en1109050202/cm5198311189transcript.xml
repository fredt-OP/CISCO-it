<brief><content-text><![CDATA[This diagram compares the use of a standard ACL with an extended ACL to prevent network 192.168.1.0 traffic from entering the 192.168.4.0 network. Traffic should be allowed to reach all other networks.<br><br>Network Topology<br>The diagram depicts four routers, R1, R2, R3, and R4, connected by serial links to each other. On R1 there is an extended ACL placed on F A 0 /0 which connects network 192.168.1.0 /24 to R1. <br><br>The extended ACL information appears as follows:<br><br>Extended ACL<br>Place closest to source <br>Denies traffic from 192.168.1.0 network from reaching 192.168.4.0<br>Allows it to reach other networks and saves bandwidth<br><br>ACL commands<br>access-list 101 deny ip 192.168.1.0<br>0.0.0.255 192.168.4.0 0.0.0.255 <br>access-list 101 permit ip any any<br><br>Network Topology Continued<br>R2 is connected to network 192.168.2.0 /24 and is also connected to R4. Router R3 connects to both R1 and R4. R3 is connected to network 192.168.3.0 /24. Router R4 has its FastEthernet F A 0 /0 O U T in use and connected to network 192.168.4.0 /24. There is a Standard ACL placed between the 192.168.4.0 /24 network and the interface.<br><br>The Standard ACL information is as follows:<br><br>Standard ACL<br>Place closest to the destination<br>Denies 192.168.1.0 traffic to 192.168.4.0<br>Wastes bandwidth<br><br>ACL commands<br>access-list 1 deny 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255<br>access-list 1 permit any<br>]]></content-text></brief>
