<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts output when using the following commands: R1# show IP route, R1# debug IP rip, R2# show IP route, R2# (console logging on), R2# debug IP rip, R2# show access-lists, and R2# show IP interface s0/0/0.<br><br>Network Topology <br>Two hosts are directly connected to a switch. The two hosts have the IP addresses 192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.3, and are part of the 192.168.1.0 /24 network. The switch is connected to the router, R1. R1 S0/0/0 is connected to router, R2, S0/0/0, and are part of the 172.20.1.0 /30 network. An ACL (123) has been placed on the serial interface S0/0/0 inbound on R2. R2 F A 0 /0 is connected to another switch, 192.168.2.0 /24. A server is connected to the switch with an IP address of 192.168.2.2.<br><br>Only sections of each command are shown below. All other output from the commands is omitted. Complete outputs may be seen in the Hands-on Labs or Packet Tracer Activities.<br><br>R1 # show IP route <br>   R   192.168.2.0 /24  [120 /1] via 172.20.1.2, 00:00:06, Serial 0/0/0<br><br>R1 # debug IP rip<br>*Sep 19 21:12:59622:  RIP:  received v2 update from 172.20.1.2 on Serial0/0/0<br>*Sep 19 21:12:59622:     192.168.2.0 /24 via 0.0.0.0. in 1 hops<br>*Sep 19 21:12:59622:  RIP:  sending v2 update to 224.0.0.9 via Serial0/0/0 (172.20.1.1)<br><br>R2 # show IP route<br>(No output is highlighted here for this command.)<br><br>R2 # (console logging on)<br>*Sep 19 20:21:28.139:  %SEC-6 IP ACCESS LOG N P:  list 1 denied 0 172.20.1.1 -> 224.0.0.9<br><br>R2 # debug IP rip<br>(No output is highlighted here for this command.)<br><br>R2 # show access-lists<br>   20 deny any (matches)<br><br>R2 # show IP interface s0/0/0<br>Outgoing access list is not set<br>Inbound access list is 1<br>]]></content-text></brief>
