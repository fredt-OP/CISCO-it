<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a network, and shows screen captures of some of the various commands used for RIP, EIGRP, OSPF. <br><br>Network Topology<br>There are three routers, R1, R2, and ISP.<br>R1 is connected to R2 via Serial link (R1: S0/0/0, R2: S0/0/0, Network: 172.20.1.0 /30).<br>R2 is connected to ISP via Serial link (R2: S0/0/1, ISP: S0/0/0, Network: 209.165.220.224 /30).<br>R1 has network 192.168.1.0 /24 attached on the F A 0 /0 interface.<br>R2 has network 192.168.2.0 /24 attached on the F A 0 /0 interface.<br>I S P has network 10.1.1.0 /24 attached on Lo0.<br><br>Only sections of each output from R1 and R2 are shown below. All other output from the commands is omitted. Complete outputs are available in the Hands-on Labs or Packet Tracer Activities.<br><br>RIP<br>R2# show running-config<br>(No output is highlighted here for this command.)<br><br>R2# show IP route<br>Gateway of last resort is 209.165.200.226 to network 0.0.0.0<br><br>S* 0.0.0.0 /0 [1 /0] via 209.165.200.226<br><br>EIGRP<br>R1# show IP route<br>Gateway of last resort is 209.165.200.226 to network 0.0.0.0<br><br>S* 0.0.0.0 /0 [1 /0] via 209.165.200.226<br><br>R2# show running-config<br>(No output is highlighted here for this command.)<br><br>OSPF<br>R2# show running-config<br>(No output is highlighted here for this command.)<br><br>R2# show IP route<br>Gateway of last resort is 209.165.200.226 to network 0.0.0.0<br><br>S* 0.0.0.0 /0 [1 /0] via 209.165.200.226<br>]]></content-text></brief>
