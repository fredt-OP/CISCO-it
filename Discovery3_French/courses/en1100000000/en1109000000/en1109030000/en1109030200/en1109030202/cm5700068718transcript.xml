<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a network, and shows a screen capture of some of the EIGRP related show commands.<br><br>Network Topology<br>There are three routers, R1, R2, and R3.<br>R1 is connected to R2 via Serial link (R1: S0/0/0, R2:S0/0/0, Network: 172.20.1.0 /30).<br>R1 is connected to R3 via Serial link (R1: S0/0/1, R3: S0/0/1, Network: 172.20.1.4 /30).<br>R2 is connected to R3 via Serial link (R2: S0/0/1, R3: S0/0/0, Network: 172.20.1.8 /30).<br>R1 has network 192.168.1.0 /24 attached to the F A 0 /0 interface.<br>R2 has network 192.168.2.0 /24 attached to the F A 0 /0 interface.<br>R3 has network 192.168.3.0 /24 attached to the F A 0 /0 interface.<br><br>Only sections of each command are shown below. All other output from the commands is omitted. Complete outputs  are available in the Hands-on Labs or Packet Tracer Activities.<br><br>R1# show IP route<br>NOTE: Missing route 192.168.2.0 /24 in the routing table.<br><br>R2# show IP route<br>NOTE: No routes learned from other EIGRP routers. Check EIGRP configuration on R1 and R3.<br><br>R1# show IP EIGRP neighbors<br>IP-EIGRP neighbors for process 101<br>NOTE: Using A S # / process 101, the only neighbor adjacency formed is with R3.<br><br>R2# show IP EIGRP neighbors<br>IP-EIGRP neighbors for process 11<br>NOTE: Using A S # / process 11, no neighbor adjacencies have formed. R2 is configured with the wrong A S number.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
