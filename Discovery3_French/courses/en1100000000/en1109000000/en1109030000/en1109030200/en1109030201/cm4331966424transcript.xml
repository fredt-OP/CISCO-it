<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a network, and shows a screen capture of some of the show commands. <br><br>Network Topology<br>There are three routers, R1, R2, and R3.<br>R1 is connected to R2 via Serial link (R1: S0/0/0, R2: S0/0/0, Network: 172.20.1.0 /30).<br>R1 is connected to R3 via Serial link (R1: S0/0/1, R3: S0/0/1, Network: 172.20.1.4 /30).<br>R2 is connected to R3 via Serial link (R2: S0/0/1, R3: S0/0/0, Network: 172.20.1.8 /30).<br>R1 has network 192.168.1.0 /24 attached to the F A 0 /0 interface.<br>R2 has network 192.168.2.0 /24 attached to the F A 0 /0 interface.<br>R3 has network 192.168.3.0 /24 attached to the F A 0 /0 interface.<br><br>Only sections of each command are shown below. All other output from the commands is omitted. Complete outputs are available in the Hands-on Labs or Packet Tracer Activities.<br><br>R1# show IP route<br>D 192.168.2.0 /24 [90 /2172416] via 172.20.1.2, 00:11:53, Serial0/0/0<br>D 192.168.3.0 /24 [90 /2172416] via 172.20.1.6, 00:11:53, Serial0/0/1<br><br>R1# show IP protocols<br>Redistributing: EIGRP 101<br><br>Routing for Networks:<br>172.20.1.0 /30<br>172.20.1.4 /30<br>192.168.1.0<br><br>R1# show IP interface<br>Multicast reserved groups joined: 224.0.0.10<br><br>R1# show running config<br>interface FastEthernet0 /0<br>description LAN gateway for 192.168.1.0 net<br>IP address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0<br><br>interface Serial0/0/0<br>description WAN link to R2<br>IP address 172.20.1.1 255.255.255.252<br><br>interface Serial0/0/1<br>description WAN link to R3<br>IP address 172.20.1.5 255.255.255.252<br><br>router EIGRP 101<br>network 172.20.1.0 0.0.0.3<br>network 172.20.1.4 0.0.0.3<br>network 192.168.1.0<br>no auto-summary<br><br>R1# show IP EIGRP neighbors<br>H - 1<br>Address - Num - 172.20.1.2<br>Interface - S e0/0/0<br>Hold - 10<br>Uptime - 00:13:59<br>SRTT - 1<br>RTO - 200<br>Q - 0<br>Seq - 18<br><br>H - 0<br>Address - 172.20.1.6<br>Interface - S e0/0/1<br>Hold - 12<br>Uptime - 00:15:29<br>SRTT - 1<br>RTO - 200<br>Q - 0<br>Seq - 21<br><br>R1# show IP EIGRP topology<br>(No output is highlighted here for this command.)<br><br>R1# show IP EIGRP traffic<br>Hellos sent/received: 1102 /469<br>Updates sent/received: 10 /19<br>Queries sent/received: 0 /5<br>Replies sent/received: 5 /0<br>Acks sent/received: /11<br><br>R1# debug EIGRP packets<br>(No output is highlighted here for this command.)<br><br>R1# debug IP EIGRP<br>(No output is highlighted here for this command.)<br>]]></content-text></brief>
