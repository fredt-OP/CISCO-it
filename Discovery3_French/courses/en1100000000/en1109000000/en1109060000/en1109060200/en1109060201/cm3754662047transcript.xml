<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Critical Thinking<br><br>Answer the following questions based on the exhibit.<br><br>Exhibit Network Topology<br>There are two routers, R2 and R3.<br>There are two switches, S1 and S2.<br>R2 is connected to R3 via serial link (network: 192.168.16.0 /30).<br>R2 has S1 attached (network: 10.1 0.4.0 /24).<br>R3 has S2 attached (network: 10.1 0.3.0 /24).<br>S1 has one host attached (Host IP: 10.1 0.4.63 /24).<br>S2 has one host attached (Host IP: 10.1 0.3.75 /24).<br><br>There is a screen capture of the output of R2 which appears, as follows:<br><br>hostname R2<br>[output omitted]<br>interface F A 0 /0<br>   IP address 10.10.4.1 255.255.255.0<br>interface s0/0<br>   IP address 192.168.16.1 255.25.255.252<br>!<br>router rip<br>   network 192.168.16.0<br>   network 10.0.0.0<br>[output omitted]<br><br>One. Which route advertisements does R3 receive from R2?<br>a.10.0.0.0 /24.<br>b.10.10.4.0 /24.<br>c.10.0.0.0 /8.<br>d.10.0.0.0 /8 and 10.10.4.0 /24.<br>e.10.0.0.8, 10.0.0.0 /24 and 10.10.4.0 /24.<br><br>Two. If host 10.10.3.75 attempts to ping host 10.1 0.4.63, what will the results be?<br>a.All packets will be dropped.<br>b.Some packets will be dropped.<br>c.All packets will reach the destination and network applications will have connectivity.<br>d.All packets will reach the destination but network applications will not have connectivity.<br><br>Three. What must an administrator do on R3 to ensure that update packets are sent with subnet mask information?<br>a.Add the command: R2 (config-router)  # no version 2.<br>b.Add the command: R3 (config-router)  # version 2, R3 (config-router) # no auto-summary.<br>c.Change the network statement on Router 3: R3(config)# network 10.1 0.4.0.<br>d.Add the command: R3 (config ) # IP route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 s0/0.<br><br>Four. R1 and R3 is configured with the commands: <br><br>version 2<br>no auto-summary<br><br>Which two statements are true? (Choose two.)<br>a.A ping command will be successful between host 10.1 0.3.75 and host 10.1 0.4.63.<br>b.R2 is able to send and receive RIP v1 and RIP v2 update packets.<br>c.R2 is able to receive RIP v1 and RIP v2 update packets.<br>d.A ping command will fail between host 10.1 0.3.75 and host 10.1 0.4.63.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
