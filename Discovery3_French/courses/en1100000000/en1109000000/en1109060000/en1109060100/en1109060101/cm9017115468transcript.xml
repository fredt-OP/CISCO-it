<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Diagram 1, Image<br><br>The diagram depicts a hierarchal network design.<br><br>Diagram 1 text<br><br>Adherence to the three-layer hierarchical network design model assists in troubleshooting efforts.<br>Network monitoring tools include: network utilities, packet sniffing tools, and SNMP monitoring tools.<br>SNMP enables monitoring the performance of individual devices on the network using agents and a MIB.<br>Backups of the configuration files, spare devices, or backup sites enable quick restoration of connectivity.<br>The business continuity plan details the security policy and disaster recovery plan.<br>When troubleshooting a network, determine the scope of the problem, and isolate the issue to a specific failure domain.<br><br>Diagram 2, Image<br><br>The diagram depicts two rack mounted switches and RJ-45 connections.<br><br>Diagram 2 text<br><br>The most common problems with switches occur at the Physical Layer.<br>Visually checking L E D's and cable connections assist in troubleshooting Physical Layer problems.<br>Change the priority value on a switch to force the selection of the root bridge. The route bridge should be centrally located within the network.<br>Ensure there are two VTP servers in one domain to provide backup.<br>Ensure all devices sharing V LAN information have the same VTP domain name.<br>Check the VTP revision information and mode before enabling a switch to join the network.<br><br>Diagram 3, Image<br><br>The diagram depicts a simple two router network and various output.<br><br>Diagram 3 text<br><br>Many tools exist for troubleshooting routing issues include I O S show commands, debug commands and TCP/IP utilities.<br>Use debug commands to isolate problems, not to monitor normal network operation.<br>Problems with RIP v1 include lack of VLSM support and intermixing RIP v1 and RIP v2 devices.<br>Common issues with EIGRP include: mismatched A S numbers, incorrect wildcard mask, and auto-summarization issues with discontiguous subnets.<br>The majority of OSPF problems relate to the formation of adjacencies and the synchronization of the link-state databases.<br><br>Diagram 4, Image<br><br>The diagram depicts the show controllers command from a DCE and a DTE end of two connecting routers.<br><br>Diagram 4 text<br><br>The most common physical layer WAN problems are not specifying a clock rate on the link or using the wrong type of cable.<br>SLARP assigns an IP address to the end point of a serial link if the other end is already configured.<br>Ensure that the encapsulation is the same on both sides of the serial link.<br>If an IP address is used both ends of the link must be on the same network or subnet.<br>When troubleshooting PPP connectivity verify that the LCP has been opened, authentication, and NCP completed.<br>For enhanced security, use mutual authentication. On both ends of the link, verify that a user account exists for the remote device and that the password is correct.<br>By default, the username used during the authentication process, is the name of the remote router. Both the username and the password are case sensitive.<br><br>Diagram 5, Image<br><br>The diagram depicts a network with an ACL applied.<br><br>Diagram 5 text<br><br>ACL's can create complications in troubleshooting network issues.<br>Always verify basic network connectivity before applying an ACL.<br>Enable logging to determine the effect that ACL's have on traffic.<br>ACL needs to be applied to the correct router and interface and in the correct direction.<br>Standard ACL's filter only on one source IP address so they are normally placed as close to the destination as possible.<br>An Extended ACL filters on source and destination as well as protocols and port numbers.<br>Placing an extended ACL close to a source can deny traffic before it passes though the router and before it traverses the WAN link.<br>An ACL placed on the wrong interface or in the wrong direction can block traffic that should not be blocked, or permit traffic that should not be permitted.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
