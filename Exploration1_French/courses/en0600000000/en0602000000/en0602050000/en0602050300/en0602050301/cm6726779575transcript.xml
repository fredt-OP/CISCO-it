<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts an IP phone labeled "Source end device" (IP address 209.165.202.130), which is connected through three routers to a PC destination device (IP address 209.165.200.230). In addition to the Layer 2 addresses, the PC and IP Phone PDU's also contain the Layer 3 IP source and destination addresses, each of which consists of a network portion and a host (device) portion. A PDU is shown above the diagram with a destination IP network address of 209.165.200 and device (host) address of .230 for the PC. (These two combined create the PC IP address). The IP phone has a source network address of 209.165.202 and device (host) address of 130. (These two combined create the IP phone IP address). The IP address of the router interface for the source network is 209.165.202.145, and the IP address of the router interface for the destination network is 209.165.200.226.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
