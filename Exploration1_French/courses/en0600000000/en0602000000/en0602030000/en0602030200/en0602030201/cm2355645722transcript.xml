<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the role of protocols and the concepts of format, process, error messages, and termination. An end-user PC is connected to a router that is connected to two other routers. One of the other routers is connected to a server.<br><br>Format: The format or structure of the communication pieces.<br>Router 1 speech bubble says: "Let us all agree that pieces will be 10 letters long." The user PC and router 2 say: "Okay."<br>In any communication process, there are rules.<br><br>Process: The process by which networking devices share information about pathways to other networks.<br>Router 2 speech bubble says: "Let us all agree that if one of our pathways is down, we will notify all connected devices."<br>Router 1 says: "Path A is down." Routers 2, 3, and 4 say: "Okay."<br><br>Error Messages: How and when error and system messages are passed between devices.<br>Router 2 speech bubble says: "Let us all agree that error messages will have a unique ID number."<br>Router 1 says: "Error 1002: Path B is slow."<br>Router 2 says: "Error 1001: Path A is down."<br><br>Termination: The setting up and termination of data transfer sessions.<br>Router 2 speech bubble says: "Let us all agree that sessions will end after 60 seconds of inactivity."<br>Router 2 then says: "It has been 60 seconds since the last piece arrived. Closing this session." The other router says: "Okay."<br>]]></content-text></brief>
