<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the use of Protocol Data Units (PDU's) and the encapsulation process when sending a message from a user. The user PC is connected to a router. The PDU terminology is given at each encapsulation step. The process starts when the user creates the email message, which is termed a Data PDU. As the data is passed down the protocol stack, a transport header is added, creating a Segment PDU. Next a network header is added, creating a Packet PDU. Then a frame header and trailer are added, creating a Frame PDU. Finally, the frame is transmitted on the medium as bits (zeros and ones).<br><br>PDU Summary (passing down the stack):<br>-	Data - The general term for the PDU used at the Application Layer.<br>-	Segment - Transport Layer PDU<br>-	Packet - Internetwork Layer PDU <br>-	Frame - Network Access Layer PDU<br>-	Bits - PDU used when physically transmitting data over the medium.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
