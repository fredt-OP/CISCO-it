<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts serial WAN connections in the lab. <br><br>Network Topology:<br>A small LAN is connected to router R1 on interface FA0/0. Another small LAN is connected to router R2 on interface FA 0/0. Interface S0/0 (DCE) on R1 is connected to R2 interface S0/1 (D T E) using a V dot 35 DCE female cable on R1 and a V dot 35 DCE male cable on R2. This effectively connects the two routers with a WAN serial link and bypasses the need for CSU/DSU's in a lab environment. The connection between the two cables crosses the transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) pins.]]></content-text></brief>
