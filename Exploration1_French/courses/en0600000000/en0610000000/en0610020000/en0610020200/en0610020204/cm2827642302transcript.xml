<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts various cables used to make LAN connections and identifies the correct Ethernet bandwidth, UTP cable type, and the likely category to connect different intermediate and end devices in a LAN.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>-	PC1 and PC2 are connected to Hub1 at 10 Megabits per second using Category 5 straight-through cables.<br>-	Hub1 is connected to Switch1 at 10 Megabits per second using a Category 5 crossover cable.<br>-	Switch1 is connected to Router1 at 100 Megabits per second using a Category 5 straight-through cable.<br>-	Server1 is connected to Switch2, Server2 is connected to Switch3, and Server3 is connected to Switch4. All servers are connected to a switch at 100 Megabits per second using Category 5 straight-through cables.<br>-	Switch2, Switch3, and Switch4 are connected to Router1 at 100 Megabits per second using Category 5 straight-through cables.<br>-	Router1 is connected to Router2 at 100 Megabits per second using a Category 5 crossover cable.]]></content-text></brief>
