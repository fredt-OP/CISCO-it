<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts factors determining LAN switch selection, which include port speeds, types, and expandability.<br><br>A 1000 megabits per second (1 Gigabit per second) switch is shown with two 10 megabits per second PC's and two 100 megabits per second PC's connected. The same switch demonstrates expandability and is shown with two 100 megabits per second PC's and two 1000 megabits per second servers connected.<br><br>Three switches are shown with different port configurations as follows:<br>1. All ports are one speed and type (UTP ports at a speed of 10 megabits per second).<br>2. All ports are one type and have multiple speeds (UTP ports at speeds of 10 and 100 megabits per second).<br>3. Two type of ports, multiple speeds (UTP ports with speeds of multiple 10 and 100 megabits per second, and one fiber port with a speed of one Gigabit per second).<br><br>Some switches can be expanded to meet new requirements with additional modules.]]></content-text></brief>
