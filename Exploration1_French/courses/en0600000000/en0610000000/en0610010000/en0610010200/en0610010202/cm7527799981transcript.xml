<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts factors in determining LAN switch selection. Three topologies are shown.<br><br>Topology 1. One large, central switch with many PC's connected.<br><br>Topology 2. Multiple switches, connected to a central switch in an extended star topology. PC's are connected to four outer switches, which are connected to the central switch.<br><br>Topology 3. Two central switches are connected depicting redundancy. PC's are connected to four outer switches, which are connected to two central switches with redundant links. An arrow points to two of the outer switches with text explaining that a failure on any of these switches only affects the directly connected PC's. An arrow points to the two central switches with text explaining that the failure of either of these central switches does not stop network operation.]]></content-text></brief>
