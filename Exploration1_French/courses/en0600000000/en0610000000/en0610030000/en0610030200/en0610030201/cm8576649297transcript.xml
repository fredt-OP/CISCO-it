<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts the counting of subnets in a network.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>LAN A with two PC's and a switch is connected to router R1's Ethernet interface.<br>LAN B with two PC's and a switch is connected to router R2's Ethernet interface.<br>LAN C with two PC's and a switch is connected to router R3's Ethernet interface.<br>Router R1 is connected to router R2 via a WAN link. Router R3 is connected to Router R2 via a WAN link.<br><br>As the animation progresses, various areas of the network are highlighted, indicating that they are distinct subnets that must be accounted for.<br><br>Subnet 1. LAN A PC's and router R1's Ethernet interface.<br>Subnet 2. Router R1 to router R2 WAN link.<br>Subnet 3. LAN B PC's and router R2's Ethernet interface.<br>Subnet 4. Router R3 to router R2 WAN link.<br>Subnet 5. LAN C PC's and router R3's Ethernet interface.]]></content-text></brief>
