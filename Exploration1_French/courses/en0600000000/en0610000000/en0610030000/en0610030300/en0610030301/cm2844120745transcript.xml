<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts designing an internetwork address standard. A topology is shown with three LAN's interconnected by two routers. This represents four networks as follows:<br>LAN A - 192.168.1.x/24<br>WAN link - 192.168.2.x/24<br>LAN B - 192.168.3.x/24<br>LAN C - 192.168.4.x/24<br><br>The various end-user and network devices require host addressing. Some of the different categories for hosts and a suggested addressing standard for use with the fourth octet on each network are as follows:<br>-	General user (end-user PC's): 192.168.x.64 to 192.168.x.127.<br>-	Special users (Network Administrators): 192.168.x.8 to 192.168.x.15. <br>-	Network resources (servers and printers): 192.168.x.224 to 192.168.x.239.<br>-	Router LAN interfaces: 192.168.x.250 to 192.168.x.254.<br>-	Router WAN interfaces: 168.192.x.1 and 168.192.x.2.<br>-	Management access (Network devices): 168.192.x.192 to 168.192.x.207.]]></content-text></brief>
