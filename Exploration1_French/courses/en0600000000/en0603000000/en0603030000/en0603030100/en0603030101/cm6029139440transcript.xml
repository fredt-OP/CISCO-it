<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the steps to resolving DNS addresses. <br><br>Step 1. A PC DNS client is connected to a DNS server via a network cloud.<br>Step 2. PC browser window is shown with http://www.cisco.com entered. The text box states: "The name is easy for people to use."<br>Step 3. The web server name www.cisco.com is sent to the DNS server.<br>Step 4. The DNS server looks up the name www.cisco.com and matches it to IP address 198.133.219.25. The conversation bubbles state: "The DNS server matches the human address with the numeric address" and "The devices use numbers."<br>Step 5. The IP address 198.133.219.25 is returned back to the client for use in making requests of the server.<br>Step 6. A human legible name is resolved to its numeric network device address, 198.133.219.25, by the DNS protocol.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
