<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a person communicating over the network and the interaction between people, software, hardware, and the O S I model. Multiple steps describe the interaction. An end user is sitting next to a computer with the seven (unlabeled) layers of the O S I model pointing to it. The O S I model has a link coming from the bottom Physical Layer going to a switch, which then connects to a router. The router connects to a WAN link.<br><br>Step 1. Initial display of the user at a computer and O S I Model.<br>Step 2. Text over user: "People create the communication."<br>Step 3. Text over computer: "Software and hardware convert communication to a digital format."<br>Step 4. Application Layer 7 is labeled. Text over Application Layer: "Application Layer services initiate the data transfer."<br>Step 5. Envelope packet starts at Layer 7 and arrow points down the stack and to the switch. Text: "The Application Layer prepares human communication for transmission over the data network."<br>Step 6. Envelope packet comes back from the switch and returns to the user. Text: "The Application Layer receives data from the network and prepares it for human use."<br>Other layers of the O S I Model are now labeled. Text: "Each layer plays its role." <br>]]></content-text></brief>
