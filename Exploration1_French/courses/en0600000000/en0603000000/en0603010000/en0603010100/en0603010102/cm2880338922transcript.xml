<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the O S I model and TCP/IP model divided into two sections: Application Layer and Data Flow Layer. The top three layers of the O S I model, Application, Presentation, and Session, map roughly to the Application Layer of the TCP/IP model. The Data Flow layers are the bottom four layers: Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical for the O S I model, and the Transport, Internet, and Network Access layers of the TCP/IP model. <br>Examples of protocols that operate at the Application Layer are:<br>-	Domain Name System (DNS)<br>-	Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)<br>An example of a protocol that operates at the Transport Layer is:<br>-	Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)<br>An example of a protocol that operates at the Internet or Network Layer is:<br>-	Post Office Protocol (POP)<br>An example of a protocol that operates at the Network Access or Data Link Layer is:<br>-	Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)<br>]]></content-text></brief>
