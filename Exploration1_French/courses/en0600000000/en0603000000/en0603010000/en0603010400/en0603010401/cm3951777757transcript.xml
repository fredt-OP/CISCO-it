<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the functions of the Applications Layer protocols, which provide the rules for communication between applications. Two O S I models are interconnected at the Application Layer by a text block with the word "Protocols". At the Physical Layer of each O S I model is a switch that connects to a router. The two routers are interconnected by a WAN link.<br><br>Functions performed by protocols include:<br>-	Define processes on either end of the communication.<br>-	Define the types of messages.<br>-	Define the syntax of messages.<br>-	Define the meaning of any informational fields.<br>-	Define how messages are sent and the expected response.<br>-	Define interaction with the next lower layer.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
