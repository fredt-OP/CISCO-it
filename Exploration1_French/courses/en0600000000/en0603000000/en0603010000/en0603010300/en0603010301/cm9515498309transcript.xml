<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts the relationship between applications and services. The O S I model Layer 1 is connected to a switch, which is connected to a router. When the animation starts, application icons and data representations are displayed:<br>-	PDA with a stylus writing text on it: "I'll be home at 5:00".<br>-	PC with text on the screen: "Our company was founded in 2001".<br>-	Phone with an analog signal coming out of it.<br>-	Video camera with a film strip coming from it.<br><br>All of these four devices, which are shown as four envelopes, use applications and services at the Application Layer. The four envelopes are then passed down the O S I model layer by layer until they reach a switch and then reach a router. The text at the end of the animation states: "Applications provide the human interface. Services follow protocols to prepare data for the network."<br>]]></content-text></brief>
