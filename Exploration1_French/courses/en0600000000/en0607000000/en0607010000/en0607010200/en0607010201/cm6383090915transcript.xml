<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts transferring frames from an Ethernet LAN to serial WAN link. Two user PC's are connected to an Ethernet switch, which is connected to router R1's LAN interface. Router R1 is connected to router R2 via a serial WAN link.<br><br>As the animation progresses, a packet is sent from user PC1 through the switch to the router R1 LAN interface. During this time, it is encapsulated in a LAN header and trailer. When the LAN encapsulated packet is forwarded by router R1 to router R2 over the WAN link, the LAN header and trailer are replaced with a WAN header and trailer.<br><br>The Data Link Layer is responsible for controlling the transfer of frames across the media.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
