<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts how nodes access the media in a logical ring topology. Multiple PC's, A, B, C, and D, are arranged with the media in a ring formation. PC A transmits a frame that travels around the ring as it is passed from PC A to PC B to PC C and then to PC D. As the animation progresses, the nodes access the media as follows.<br><br>PC A text bubble:<br>-	I need to transmit to D.<br><br>PC B text bubbles:<br>-	Is this frame for me?<br>-	No.<br><br>PC C text bubbles:<br>-	Is this frame for me?<br>-	No.<br><br>PC D text bubbles:<br>-	Is this frame for me?<br>-	Yes.]]></content-text></brief>
