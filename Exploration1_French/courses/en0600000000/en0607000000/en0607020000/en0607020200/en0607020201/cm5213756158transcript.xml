<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts media access control for shared media and compares the controlled and contention-based methods. Three PC's are connected to a common shared media. All three PC's have text bubbles that state: We need rules for how to share the media.<br><br>Controlled Access Method:<br>PC text bubbles: <br>-	PC1 - I have a packet to send, but it is not my turn. I'll wait.<br>-	PC2 - I have nothing to send.<br>-	PC3 - It is my turn to send. I will send now.<br><br>Characteristics: <br>-	Only one station transmits at a time.<br>-	Devices wanting to transmit must wait their turn.<br>-	No collisions.<br>-	Some deterministic networks use token passing.<br><br>Examples:<br>-	Token Ring<br>-	FDDI<br><br>Contention-based Access Method:<br>PC text bubbles: <br>-	All PC's have text bubbles that state: I try to send when I am ready.<br><br>Characteristics:<br>-	Stations can transmit at any time.<br>-	Collisions exist.<br>-	Mechanisms exist to resolve contention:<br>- CSMA/CD for Ethernet networks<br>- CSMA/CA for 8 0 2 dot 11 wireless networks<br><br>Examples:<br>-	Ethernet <br>-	Wireless]]></content-text></brief>
