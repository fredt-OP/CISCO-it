<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts how nodes access the media in a multi-access topology. Multiple PC's, A, B, C, D, and E, share a common bus-style media. As the animation progresses, the nodes access the media as follows. <br><br>PC A text bubbles:<br>-	I need to transmit to E.<br>-	I check for other transmissions.<br>-	No other transmissions are detected.<br>-	Transmitting.<br>The animation shows the frame successfully arriving at PC E.<br><br>PC B text bubbles:<br>-	I need to transmit to D.<br>-	I check for other transmissions.<br>-	Transmission detected. I'll wait.<br>-	No other transmissions are detected.<br>-	Transmitting.<br>The animation shows the frame successfully arriving at PC D.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
