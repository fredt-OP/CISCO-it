<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts Data Link Layer protocol characteristics in a fragile environment and in a protected environment. <br><br>Fragile environment: The diagram show two routers, each one connected to a satellite dish that is communicating with a satellite. A rain cloud above the satellite indicates bad weather to illustrate a fragile environment where a higher potential exists for data transmission errors. In a fragile environment, more controls are needed to ensure delivery. The header and trailer fields are larger because more control information is needed. Greater effort is needed to ensure delivery, resulting in higher overhead and slower transmission rates.<br><br>Protected environment: The diagram shows three PC's communicating on a wired media illustrating a more stable environment. In a protected environment, the frame arrives at its destination. Fewer controls are needed, resulting in smaller fields and smaller frames. Less effort is needed to ensure delivery, resulting in lower overhead and faster transmission rates.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
