<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) frame, a common Data Link Layer protocol for WAN's. Field names and sizes are shown in the following sequence, with information describing each. <br><br>Flag: 1 byte. Indicates the beginning or end of a frame. The flag consists of the binary sequence 01111110.<br>Address: 1 byte. Contains the standard PPP broadcast address. PPP does not assign individual station addresses.<br>Control: 1 byte. Contains the binary sequence 00000011, which calls for transmission of user data in an unsequenced frame.<br>Protocol: 2 bytes. Identifies the protocol encapsulated in the data field of the frame. The most up-to-date values of the protocol field are specified in the most recent Assigned Numbers Request For Comments (RFC).<br>Data: Variable number of bytes. Zero or more bytes that contain the datagram for the protocol specified in the protocol field.<br>Frame Check Sequence (FCS): 2 or 4 bytes. Normally, 16 bits (2 bytes). By prior agreement, consenting PPP implementations can use a 32-bit (4-byte) FCS for improved error detection.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
