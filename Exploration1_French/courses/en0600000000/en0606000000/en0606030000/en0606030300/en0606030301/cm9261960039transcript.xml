<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts device IP address ranges for the network address 172.16.x.0 for user hosts, servers, peripherals, networking devices, and routers. <br><br>Network Topology:<br>Two LAN's, LAN A (172.16.1.0/24) and LAN B (172.16.2.0/24), are interconnected by router R1. In LAN A, three wired workstations, a printer, a server, and a wireless access point (AP), are connected to switch S1. Switch S1 is connected to router R1. Three wireless laptops are connected to the AP.<br><br>In LAN B, one wired workstation, a printer, and three servers, are connected to switch S2. Switch S2 is connected to router R1.<br><br>Network Address: 172.16.x.0 (LAN A is 172.16.1.0/24, and LAN B is 172.16.2.0/24).<br><br>Use: User hosts (DHCP pool)<br>First Address: 172.16.x.1<br>Last Address: 172.16.x.127<br>Summary Address: 172.16.x.0/25<br><br>Use: Servers<br>First Address: 172.16.x.128<br>Last Address: 172.16.x.191<br>Summary Address: 172.16.x.128/26<br><br>Use: Peripherals (printers in the diagram)<br>First Address: 172.16.x.192<br>Last Address: 172.16.x.223<br>Summary Address: 172.16.x.192/27<br><br>Use: Networking devices (AP's in the diagram)<br>First Address: 172.16.x.224<br>Last Address: 172.16.x.253<br>Summary Address: 172.16.x.224/27<br><br>Use: Router (gateway)<br>First Address: 172.16.x.254<br><br>Use: Broadcast<br>First Address: 172.16.x.255]]></content-text></brief>
