<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts creating eight logical networks or subnets from a single address block. This is accomplished by borrowing three bits from the host portion of the IPv4 address. Five of these subnets are shown being assigned to one of the LAN interfaces on two routers, and one is assigned to the WAN between the two routers.<br><br>The example starts with network address 192.168.1.0/24, which has 24 bits in the network address and eight bits in the host portion. <br><br>In the example, three bits are borrowed from the host portion of the address to create eight subnets. This increases the network portion to 27 bits, and the host portion is now five bits. The eight subnets created each have 32 addresses (minus two). The subnet mask with eight subnets in decimal form is 255.255.255.224.<br><br>Subnet 0<br>Network address: 192.168.1.0/27<br>Host range: 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.30<br>Broadcast address: 192.168.1.31<br><br>Subnet 1<br>Network address: 192.168.1.32/27<br>Host range: 192.168.1.33 to 192.168.1.62<br>Broadcast address: 192.168.1.63<br><br>Subnet 2<br>Network address: 192.168.1.64/27<br>Host range: 192.168.1.65 to 192.168.1.94<br>Broadcast address: 192.168.1.95<br><br>Subnet 3<br>Network address: 192.168.1.96/27<br>Host range: 192.168.1.97 to 192.168.1.126<br>Broadcast address: 192.168.1.127<br><br>Subnet 4<br>Network address: 192.168.1.128/27<br>Host range: 192.168.1.129 to 192.168.1.158<br>Broadcast address: 192.168.1.159<br><br>Subnet 5<br>Network address: 192.168.1.160/27<br>Host range: 192.168.1.161 to 192.168.1.190<br>Broadcast address: 192.168.1.191<br><br>Subnet 6<br>Network address: 192.168.1.192/27<br>Host range: 192.168.1.193 to 192.168.1.222<br>Broadcast address: 192.168.1.223<br><br>Subnet 7<br>Network address: 192.168.1.224/27<br>Host range: 192.168.1.225 to 192.168.1.254<br>Broadcast address: 192.168.1.255]]></content-text></brief>
