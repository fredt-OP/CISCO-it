<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts creating four logical networks or subnets from a single address block. This is accomplished by borrowing two bits from the host portion of the IPv4 address. Three of these subnets are shown being assigned to a LAN router interface.<br><br>The example starts with network address 192.168.1.0/24, which has 24 bits in the network address and 8 bits in the host portion. <br><br>In the example, two bits are borrowed from the host portion of the address to create four subnets. This increases the network portion to 26 bits, and the host portion is now six bits. The four subnets created each have 64 addresses (minus two). The subnet mask with four subnets in decimal form is 255.255.255.192.<br><br>Subnet 0<br>Network address: 192.168.1.0/26<br>Host range: 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.62<br>Broadcast address: 192.168.1.63<br><br>Subnet: 1<br>Network address: 192.168.1.64/26<br>Host range: 192.168.1.65 to 192.168.1.126<br>Broadcast address: 192.168.1.127<br><br>Subnet 2<br>Network address: 192.168.1.128/26<br>Host range: 192.168.1.129 to 192.168.1.190<br>Broadcast address: 192.168.1.191<br><br>Subnet 3<br>Network address: 192.168.1.192/26<br>Host range: 192.168.1.193 to 192.168.1.254<br>Broadcast address: 192.168.1.255]]></content-text></brief>
