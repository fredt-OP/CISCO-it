<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts creating two logical networks or subnets from a single address block. This is accomplished by borrowing a bit from the host portion of the IP IPv4 address. Each subnet is shown being assigned to a LAN router interface.<br><br>The example starts with network address 192.168.1.0/24, which has 24 bits in the network address and 8 bits in the host portion The subnet mask in decimal form is 255.255.255.0. Eight bits in the host portion allow 256 combinations of zeros and ones or unique IP addresses. The first address (network address 00000000) and last address (broadcast address 11111111) cannot be used as host IP addresses.<br><br>In the example, one bit is borrowed from the host portion of the address to create two subnets. This increases the network portion to 25 bits, and the host portion is now seven bits. The two subnets created each have 128 addresses (minus two). The subnet mask with two subnets in decimal form is 255.255.255.128.<br><br>Subnet 0<br>Network address: 192.168.1.0/25<br>Host range: 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.126<br>Broadcast address: 192.168.1.127<br><br>Subnet 1<br>Network address: 192.168.1.128/25<br>Host range: 192.168.1.129 to 192.168.1.254<br>Broadcast address: 192.168.1.255<br>]]></content-text></brief>
