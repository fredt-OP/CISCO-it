<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts dividing networks into right sizes using subnets.<br><br>Network Topology<br>A large corporate network consisting of four LAN's, a Corporate HQ, Legal office, HR office, and Sales office is shown. Each LAN contains multiple hosts and a router at the edge. There are three WAN links. One WAN link connects the Corporate HQ router to each of the other three offices.<br><br>Number of hosts and subnetting requirements<br>There are 800 hosts total in the corporate network. The block of addresses chosen to accommodate all the hosts is 172.16.0.0/22, which provides 10 host bits and allows for 1,022 IP addresses (2 to the tenth power is 1,024 minus 2). Network address block 172.16.0.0/22 is divided into different-sized subnets to accommodate the number of users at each of the offices and the WAN links between them. The largest blocks are allocated first.<br><br>Entire Corporate Network: 172.16.0.0/22<br><br>Location: Corporate HQ<br>Number of users: 500<br>Subnet: 172.16.0.0/23<br>Number of host bits: 9<br>Number of hosts possible: 510 (512 minus 2)<br><br>Location: Sales office<br>Number of users: 200<br>Subnet: 172.16.2.0/24<br>Number of host bits: 8<br>Number of hosts possible: 254 (256 minus 2)<br><br>Location: HR office<br>Number of users: 50<br>Subnet: 172.16.3.0/26<br>Number of host bits: 6<br>Number of hosts possible: 62 (64 minus 2)<br><br>Location: Legal office<br>Number of users: 20<br>Subnet: 172.16.3.64/27<br>Number of host bits: 5<br>Number of hosts possible: 30 (32 minus 2)<br>]]></content-text></brief>
