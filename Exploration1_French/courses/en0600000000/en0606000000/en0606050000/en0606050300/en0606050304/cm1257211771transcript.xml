<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts a summary of the network requirements previously described and how it is more efficient to use a variable length subnet mask (VLSM). The same network topology is also displayed, showing how each network and the number of unused addresses are greatly reduced. <br><br>The following lists the various networks, addressing requirements, and the number of unused addresses now that a VLSM is employed.<br><br>AtlantaHQ LAN address: 192.168.15.0/26<br>Actual requirements: 58 host addresses<br>Hosts allowed with a /26 subnet: 62<br>Unused host addresses: 4 <br><br>PerthHQ LAN address: 192.168.15.64/27<br>Actual requirements: 26 host addresses<br>Hosts allowed with a /27 subnet: 30<br>Unused host addresses: 4 <br><br>SydneyHQ LAN address: 192.168.15.96/28<br>Actual requirements: 10 host addresses<br>Hosts allowed with a /28 subnet: 14<br>Unused host addresses: 4 <br><br>CorpusHQ LAN address: 192.168.15.112/28<br>Actual requirements: 10 host addresses<br>Hosts allowed with a /28 subnet: 14<br>Unused host addresses: 4 <br><br>Network WAN link address: various 192.168.15.xxx/30<br>Actual requirements: 2 host addresses<br>Hosts allowed with a /30 subnet: 2<br>Unused host addresses: 0 ]]></content-text></brief>
