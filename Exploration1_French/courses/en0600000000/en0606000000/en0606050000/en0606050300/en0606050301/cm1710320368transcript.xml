<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts an example of subnetting the 192.168.20.0/24 network block into eight equal-sized subnets by borrowing 3 bits and using a /27 prefix for LAN's. Next, one of the /27 subnets is subnetted by borrowing another 3 bits and using a /30 mask to create eight small subnets for use with the WAN links.<br><br>Network Topology<br>Four routers are shown, Building A, Building B, Building C, and Building C. Three WAN links connect these four routers. Each router has a LAN connected to it for a total of four LAN's.<br><br>Step 1:<br><br>Network number 192.168.20.0/24 is subnetted into eight subnets.<br><br>Subnet 0<br>Subnet address: 192.168.20.0/27<br>Subnet 1<br>Subnet address: 192.168.20.32/27<br>Subnet 2<br>Subnet address: 192.168.20.64/27<br>Subnet 3<br>Subnet address: 192.168.20.96/27<br>Subnet 4<br>Subnet address: 192.168.20.128/27<br>Subnet 5<br>Subnet address: 192.168.20.160/27<br>Subnet 6<br>Subnet address: 192.168.20.192/27<br>Subnet 7<br>Subnet address: 192.168.20.224/27<br><br>Step 2:<br><br>The sixth subnet with address 192.168.20.192/27 from the previous step is subnetted into eight more subnets with only two valid host addresses in each one (4 minus 2).<br><br>Subnet 0<br>Subnet address: 192.168.20.192/30<br>Subnet 1<br>Subnet address: 192.168.20.196/30<br>Subnet 2<br>Subnet address: 192.168.20.200/30<br>Subnet 3<br>Subnet address: 192.168.20.204/30<br>Subnet 4<br>Subnet address: 192.168.20.208/30<br>Subnet 5<br>Subnet address: 192.168.20.212/30<br>Subnet 6<br>Subnet address: 192.168.20.216/30<br>Subnet 7<br>Subnet address: 192.168.20.220/30<br><br>Subnet addresses are assigned to the network LAN's and WAN links as follows:<br><br>Router Building A LAN subnet address: 192.168.20.0/27<br>Router Building B LAN subnet address: 192.168.20.32/27<br>Router Building C LAN subnet address: 192.168.20.64/27<br>Router Building D LAN subnet address: 192.168.20.96/27<br>Building A to Building B WAN link subnet address: 192.168.20.192/30<br>Building B to Building C WAN link subnet address: 192.168.20.196/30<br>Building C to Building D WAN link subnet address: 192.168.20.200/30<br>]]></content-text></brief>
