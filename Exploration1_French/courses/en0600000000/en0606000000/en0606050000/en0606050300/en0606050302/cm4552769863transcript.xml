<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts an example of the inefficiency of standard subnetting. A network block is divided into equal-sized subnets with 62 (64 minus 2) hosts allowed on each using a /26 prefix. <br><br>Network Topology<br>Four routers are shown, AtlantaHQ, SydneyHQ, CorpusHQ, and PerthHQ. Three WAN links connect these four routers. Each router has a LAN connected to it for a total of four LAN's.<br><br>For the AtlantaHQ LAN, which requires 58 IP addresses, most of the addresses are used. Subtracting 58 from 62 results in only four unused addresses. However, the SydneyHQ LAN, which requires only 10 IP addresses, has many unused addresses. Subtracting 10 from 62 results in 52 unused addresses. The number of unused addresses for WAN links is even greater. A WAN link requires only two IP addresses, resulting in 60 unused addresses.<br><br>The following lists the various networks, addressing requirements, and the number of unused addresses.<br><br>AtlantaHQ LAN: <br>Actual requirements: 58 host addresses<br>Unused addresses: 4 addresses<br><br>PerthHQ LAN:<br>Actual requirements: 26 host addresses<br>Unused addresses: 36 addresses<br><br>SydneyHQ LAN:<br>Actual requirements: 10 host addresses<br>Unused addresses: 52 addresses<br><br>CorpusHQ LAN:<br>Actual requirements: 10 host addresses<br>Unused addresses: 52 addresses<br><br>Network WAN links:<br>Actual requirements: 2 host addresses<br>Unused addresses: 60 addresses]]></content-text></brief>
