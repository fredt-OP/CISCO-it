<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts testing a host PC's connectivity to a remote host by pinging the IP address of the remote host. <br><br>As the animation progresses, PC1 with IP address 10.0.0.1 sends an echo request to PC2 IP address 10.0.1.1 on the remote network. The packet travels from PC1 through the local LAN switch and then to the router LAN interface F0.

PC2 sends an echo reply back to PC1 using the reverse path.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
