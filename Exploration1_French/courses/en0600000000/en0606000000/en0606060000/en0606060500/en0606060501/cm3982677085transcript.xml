<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts a host PC pinging to a remote host and using the router's routing table to look up the destination network.<br><br>As the animation progresses, PC1 with IP address 10.0.0.1 sends a packet to PC2 IP address 10.0.1.1 on the remote network. The packet travels from PC1 through the local LAN switch and then to the router LAN interface F1. The router looks up the remote network 10.0.1.0 and forwards the packet out its F0 interface to the switch attached to that interface. The packet then reaches PC2. PC2 sends a reply packet back to PC1 using the reverse path. If the target PC is not available, the router can send an ICMP message back to the source host.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
