<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the steps to convert from decimal to binary for a single octet. The decimal number 172 is converted to binary 10101100 using the following process, as described in a flowchart.<br><br>Convert decimal 172 to binary 10101100:<br>Step 1. Is 172 >= 128?<br>Yes. Put a binary one in the 128-bit position (bit 8), and subtract 128 from 172, which equals 44. Go to Step 2.<br><br>Step 2. Is 44 >= 64?<br>No. Put a binary zero in the 64-bit position (bit 7) and go to step 3.<br><br>Step 3. Is 44 >= 32?<br>Yes. Put a binary one in the 32-bit position (bit 6), and subtract 32 from 44, which equals 12. Go to Step 4.<br><br>Step 4. Is 12 >= 16?<br>No. Put a binary zero in the 16-bit position (bit 5) and go to step 5.<br><br>Step 5. Is 12 >= 8?<br>Yes. Put a binary one in the 8-bit position (bit 4), and subtract 8 from 12, which equals 4. Go to Step 6.<br><br>Step 6. Is 4 >= 4?<br>Yes. Put a binary one in the 4-bit position (bit 3), and subtract 4 from 4, which equals zero. Go to Step 7.<br><br>Step 7. Because there are no more binary ones and, in step 6, there was no remainder, put a zero in the two remaining bit positions, the 2 bit and the 1 bit. The process is now completed, and the final binary value is 10101100.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
