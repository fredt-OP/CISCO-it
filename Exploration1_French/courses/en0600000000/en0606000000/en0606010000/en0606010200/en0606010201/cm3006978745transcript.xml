<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts binary-to-decimal conversion for a single octet. The binary number 11110101 is converted to decimal 245 using the following process:<br><br>For an octet, the bit positions from left to right have these bit values:<br>Bit 8: Value is 2 to the seventh power or 128.<br>Bit 7: Value is 2 to the sixth power or 64.<br>Bit 6: Value is 2 to the fifth power or 32.<br>Bit 5: Value is 2 to the fourth power or 16.<br>Bit 4: Value is 2 to the third power or 8.<br>Bit 3: Value is 2 to the second power or 4.<br>Bit 2: Value is 2 to the first power or 2.<br>Bit 1: Value is 2 to the zero power or 1.<br><br>A one in any position means that the value of that position is added to the total decimal value for the octet. <br><br>A zero in any position means that the value of that position is zero and is not added to the total decimal value for the octet.<br><br>A decimal one in the bit 7 position is valued at 64. Adding the values of all the positions with one bits in them equals the decimal value for the octet.<br><br>In the example of binary 11110101, conversion is as follows:<br><br>One in the bit 8 position equals128, + one in the bit 7 position equals 64, + one in the bit 6 position equals 32, + one in the bit 5 position equals 16, + zero in the 5 bit position equals 0, + one in the 4 bit position equals 4, + one in the bit 2 position equals 2, + one in the bit 1 position equals 1, which all added together equals a decimal value of 245.]]></content-text></brief>
