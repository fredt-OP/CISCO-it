<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts using network prefixes to determine the network portion of the IP address, the host range, and the broadcast address for each network. The prefixes /24, /25, /26, and /27 are applied to the 172.16.4.0 network address. The same network address is used for all prefixes. The host range and broadcast address for each prefix is different.<br><br>Rollovers show the binary values for each network address, the host range, and the broadcast address for each prefix.<br><br>Rollover Notes for 172.16.4.0 /24:<br>Network address: All host bits = 0, Host bits binary 0000000<br>Host range: Represents all combinations of host bits, except where host bits are all zeros or all ones. Host bits binary: 00000001 (decimal 1) through 11111110 (decimal 254).<br>Broadcast address: All host bits = 1, Host bits binary 11111111 (decimal 255)<br><br>Examples:<br>Network: 172.16.4.0/24<br>Network address: 172.16.4.0<br>Host range: 172.16.4.1 to 172.16.4.254<br>Broadcast address: 172.16.4.255<br><br>Network: 172.16.4.0/25<br>Network address: 172.16.4.0<br>Host range: 172.16.4.1 to 172.16.4.126<br>Broadcast address: 172.16.4.127<br><br>Network: 172.16.4.0/26<br>Network address: 172.16.4.0<br>Host range: 172.16.4.1 to 172.16.4.62<br>Broadcast address: 172.16.4.63<br><br>Network: 172.16.4.0/27<br>Network address: 172.16.4.0<br>Host range: 172.16.4.1 to 172.16.4.30<br>Broadcast address: 172.16.4.31]]></content-text></brief>
