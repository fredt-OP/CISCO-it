<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts three address types within the address range of each IPv4 network: network, broadcast, and host. Three host PC's and a printer are shown connecting to a switch on the 10.0.0.0/24 network.<br><br>Network address: 10.0.0.0 refers to the network as a whole. All devices in this network have the same network address bits.<br><br>Broadcast address: In the example, the broadcast address is 10.0.0.255. It is used to send packets to every host in the network that shares the same network portion of the address. <br><br>Host address: Each host in this network has a unique address. In the example, the PC host addresses are 10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2, and 10.0.0.3, and the printer is host address 10.0.0.253.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
