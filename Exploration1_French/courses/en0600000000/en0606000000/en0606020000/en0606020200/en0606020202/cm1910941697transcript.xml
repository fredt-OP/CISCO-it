<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts an activity in which you calculate the network address, host addresses, and broadcast address for given networks. <br><br>Note: You might want to contact your instructor for assistance with this activity.<br><br>Example 1. The host IP Address and prefix is 192.242.133.123/29<br>A. For the Network Address<br>-	Enter the last octet in binary: <br>-	Enter the last octet in decimal: <br>-	Enter the full address in decimal: <br><br>B. For the Broadcast Address<br>-	Enter the last octet in binary: <br>-	Enter the last octet in decimal: <br>-	Enter the full address in decimal: <br><br>C. For the first usable Host Address<br>-	Enter the last octet in binary: <br>-	Enter the last octet in decimal: <br>-	Enter the full address in decimal: <br><br>D.
