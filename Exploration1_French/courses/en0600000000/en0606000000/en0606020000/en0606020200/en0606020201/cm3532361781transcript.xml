<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts an example of the address assignment for the 172.16.20.0/25 network. A prefix of /25 provides 7 bits for host addressing. <br><br>1. Representation of the network address. With a 25-bit prefix, the last 7 bits are host bits. To represent the network address, all the host bits are zero. This makes the last octet of the address zero, and the network address is 172.16.20.0/25.<br><br>2. Calculation of the lowest host address. The host address is always one greater than the network address. In this case, the last of the seven host bits becomes a one. The lowest host address is 172.16.20.1.<br><br>3. Calculation of the broadcast address of the network. All seven host bits used in this network are all ones. From the calculation, the last octet is 127, so the broadcast address is 172.16.20.127.<br><br>4. Calculation of the highest host address. The highest host address for a network is always one less than the broadcast. This means that the lowest host bit is a zero, and all other host bits are ones. The highest host address in this network is 172.16.20.126.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
