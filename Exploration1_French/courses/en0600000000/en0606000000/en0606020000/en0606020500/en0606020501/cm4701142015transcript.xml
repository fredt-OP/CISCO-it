An edge router in each LAN is connected to a router at one of three ISP's in the Internet cloud. Without the use of Network Address Translation (NAT), these addresses are blocked at the ISP. <br><br>Private net 10.0.0.0/8 - Hosts have IP addresses 10.0.0.1 through 10.0.0.10.<br>Private net 172.16.0.0/12 - Hosts have IP addresses 172.16.0.1 through 172.16.0.7.<br>Private net 192.168.1.0/16 - Hosts have IP addresses 192.168.1.1 through 192.168.1.3.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
