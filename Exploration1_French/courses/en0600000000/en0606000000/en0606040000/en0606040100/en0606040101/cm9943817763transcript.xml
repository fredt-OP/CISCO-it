<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts an IPv4 address and subnet mask identifying the network and host portions of the IP address. IPv4 host address 172.16.4.1 is used as an example with subnet mask 255.255.255.0 (prefix /24).<br><br>Network<br>The diagram identifies the network portion of the address as the first 24 bits. In an IPv4 address, bits in the network portion can be either zero or one. In an IPv4 subnet mask, the first 24 bits are all ones, indicating that these positions are the network portion of the address.<br><br>Host<br>The diagram identifies the host portion of the address as the last 8 bits. In an IPv4 address, bits in the host portion can be either zero or one. In an IPv4 subnet mask, the last 8 bits are zeros, indicating that these positions are the host portion of the address.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
