<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts applying the subnet mask to an IP address and using the ANDing process to determine the network to which the address belongs. A device with the host address 192.0.0.1 belongs to network 192.0.0.0. Host address 192.0.0.1 is converted to binary 11000000.00000000.00000000.00000001, and subnet mask 255.255.0.0 is converted to binary 11111111.11111111.00000000.000000000. Each bit position of the IP address is compared to the corresponding position of the subnet mask using the ANDing process as follows:<br><br>1 and 1: 1 in the host AND 1 in the mask puts 1 in the network address.<br><br>0 and 1: 0 in the host AND 1 in the mask puts 0 in the network address.<br><br>0 and 0: 0 in the host AND 0 in the mask puts 0 in the network address.<br><br>1 and 0: 1 in the host AND 0 in the mask puts 0 in the network address.<br><br>The resulting network number is the binary number 11000000.00000000.00000000.00000000 or decimal 192.0.0.0. <br>]]></content-text></brief>
