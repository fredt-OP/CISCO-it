<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts interface testing using the show i p interface brief command and connectivity testing using the ping and trace route commands for a router and a switch.<br><br>Network topology:<br>A PC with IP address 192.168.254.1 is connected to a switch with IP address 192.168.254.250. The switch is connected to a router default gateway, interface FA0/0, which has IP address 192.168.254.254. The router interface S0/0/0, with IP address 172.16.0.254, is connected to a network cloud. Output from the show i p interface brief, ping, and traceroute commands is provided for the router.<br><br>Router1# show i p interface brief<br>Interface: FastEthernet0/0<br>IP Address: 192.168.254.254<br>OK?: YES<br>Method: NV RAM<br>Status: up<br>Protocol: up<br><br>Interface: FastEthernet0/1/0<br>IP Address: unassigned<br>OK?: YES<br>Method: unset<br>Status: down<br>Protocol: down<br><br>Interface: Serial0/0/0<br>IP Address: 172.16.0.254<br>OK?: YES<br>Method: NV RAM<br>Status: up<br>Protocol: up<br><br>Interface: Serial0/0/1<br>IP Address: unassigned<br>OK?: YES<br>Method: unset<br>Status: administratively down<br>Protocol: down<br><br>The ping command shows that the router is able to connect to the PC with the IP address 192.168.254.1, and the trace route command shows a successful trace to the external host address 192.168.0.1.<br><br>Output from the show i p interface brief, ping and traceroute commands is provided for the switch.<br><br>Switch1# show i p interface brief<br>Interface: V LAN1<br>IP Address: 192.168.254.250<br>OK?: YES<br>Method: manual<br>Status: up<br>Protocol: up<br><br>Interface: FastEthernet0/1<br>IP Address: unassigned<br>OK?: YES<br>Method: unset<br>Status: down<br>Protocol: down<br><br>Interface: FastEthernet0/2<br>IP Address: unassigned<br>OK?: YES<br>Method: unset<br>Status: up<br>Protocol: up<br><br>Interface: FastEthernet0/3<br>IP Address: unassigned<br>OK?: YES<br>Method: unset<br>Status: up<br>Protocol: up<br><br>output omitted<br><br>The ping command shows that the switch is able to connect to the PC with the IP address 192.168.254.1, and the traceroute command shows a successful trace to the external host address 192.168.0.1.]]></content-text></brief>
