<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts testing the local network by pinging from one host to another. The host with IP address 10.0.0.5 pings the host with IP address 10.0.0.3. Successfully pinging the other host's IPv4 addresses verifies that not only is the local host configured properly, but the other hosts are configured correctly as well.<br><br>Network topology:<br>Five hosts, A, B, C , D, and E, are connected to a switch with a management IP address. The switch is connected to a router.<br><br>Host A: 10.0.0.1/24<br>Host B: 10.0.0.2/24<br>Host C: 10.0.0.3/24<br>Host D: 10.0.0.4/24<br>Host E: 10.0.0.5/24<br>Switch: 10/0/0/254/24<br>Router: 10.0.0.250/24]]></content-text></brief>
