<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts network baselining using the ping command. The same test to a particular host is run at different times, and the roundtrip times are compared. The following is the output from two ping tests.<br><br>Test 1:<br><br>FEB 2, 2007 08:14:43<br><br>C:\>ping 10.66.254.159<br><br>Pinging 10.66.254.159 with 32 bytes of data:<br><br>Reply from 10.66.254.159: bytes=32 	time<1ms 	<br><br>TTL=128<br>Reply from 10.66.254.159: bytes=32 	time<1ms 	<br><br>TTL=128<br>Reply from 10.66.254.159: bytes=32 	time<1ms 	<br><br>TTL=128<br>Reply from 10.66.254.159: bytes=32 	time<1ms 	<br><br>TTL=128<br><br>Ping statistics for 10.66.254.159:<br>Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss), <br>Approximate roundtrip time in milliseconds:<br><br>Test 2:<br><br>MAR 17, 2007 14:41:06<br><br>C:\>ping 10.66.254.159<br><br>Pinging 10.66.254.159 with 32 bytes of data:<br><br>Reply from 10.66.254.159: bytes=32 	time<6ms 	<br><br>TTL=128<br>Reply from 10.66.254.159: bytes=32 	time<6ms 	<br><br>TTL=128<br>Reply from 10.66.254.159: bytes=32 	time<6ms 	<br><br>TTL=128<br>Reply from 10.66.254.159: bytes=32 	time<6ms 	<br><br>TTL=128<br><br>Ping statistics for 10.66.254.159:<br>Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss), <br>Approximate roundtrip time in milliseconds:<br><br>In Test 2, the reply time increased from 1 millisecond to 6 milliseconds.]]></content-text></brief>
