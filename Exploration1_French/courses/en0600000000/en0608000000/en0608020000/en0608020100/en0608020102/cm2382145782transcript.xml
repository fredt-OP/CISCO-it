<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts signaling bits for transmission using non-return to zero (NRZ). A one bit is represented by a positive voltage pulse, and a zero bit is represented by zero voltage. The height of the positive voltage pulse is the amplitude. The width of a pulse or absence of one is one bit-time.<br><br>Characteristics of NRZ include:<br>-	Discrete pulses (not continuous)<br>-	Can only have one of two states (1/0, on/off)<br>-	Voltage jumps between levels]]></content-text></brief>
