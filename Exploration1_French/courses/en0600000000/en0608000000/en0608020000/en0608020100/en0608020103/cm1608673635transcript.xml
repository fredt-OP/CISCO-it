<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts signaling bits for transmission using Manchester Encoding.<br><br>In the Manchester Encoding scheme, bit values are represented as voltage transitions. A transition from a low voltage to a high voltage represents a bit value of one. A transition from a high voltage to a low voltage represents a bit value of zero. One voltage transition must occur in the middle of each bit time.]]></content-text></brief>
