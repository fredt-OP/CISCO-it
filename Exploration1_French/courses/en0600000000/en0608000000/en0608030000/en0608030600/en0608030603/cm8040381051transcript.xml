<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts single-mode and multimode fiber cable design. <br><br>Single-Mode: <br>Components from the outside in are:<br>-	Polymeric Coating<br>-	Glass Cladding 125 microns diameter<br>-	Glass Core=8 to 10 microns<br>Characteristics include:<br>-	Produces a single, straight path for light.<br>-	Small core.<br>-	Less dispersion.<br>-	Suited for long distance applications (up to 100 Kilometers or 62.14 miles).<br>-	Uses lasers as the light source, often within campus backbones for a distance of several thousand meters.<br><br>Multimode: <br>Components from the outside in are:<br>-	Polymeric Coating<br>-	Glass Cladding 125 microns diameter<br>-	Glass Core=50/62.5 microns<br>Characteristics include:<br>-	Allows multiple paths for light.<br>-	Larger core than single-mode cable (50 microns or greater).<br>-	Allows greater dispersion and, therefore, loss of signal.<br>-	Used for long-distance application, but shorter than single-mode (up to approximately 2 kilometers or 6,560 feet).<br>-	Uses L E D's as the light source, often within LAN's or distances of a couple hundred meters within a campus network.]]></content-text></brief>
