<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the steps in the process of sending an instant message.<br>Step 1. User types in the IM application.<br>Step 2. Instant messages are converted to binary bits before they are transmitted on the medium. <br>Step 3. The network interface card inside the PC generates electrical signals to represent the bits and places the bits on the medium. The bits arrive at the first network device.<br>Step 4. The bits are passed from device to device in the local area. As bits leave the local area, they usually pass through a router. A router plays a key role, because it both joins networks together and ensures that communication is directed toward its destination.<br>Step 5. The bits are transmitted to the devices that connect the local networks. There can be dozens, even hundreds, of devices handling the bits as they are routed to their destination. From this perspective, the many interconnected devices worldwide are often represented as a cloud.<br>Step 6. As the bits get close to their destination, they once again get passed through local devices.<br>Step 7. The destination device reads the bits and converts them back to the human-readable message. <br><br>The completed diagram at the end of step 7 shows a person sending the IM from a desktop computer, which then passes through a switch, a router, a data network cloud, another router, a wireless router, and finally to a wireless PDA.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
