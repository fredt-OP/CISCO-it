<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts circuit switching in a telephone network. Five telephone switches are interconnected within a cloud. A phone is connected to two of the switches, one on either side of the cloud. A specific path (dedicated circuit) is highlighted through three of the switches from one phone to the other.<br>Many paths are possible, but only one path is selected per call. When a call is established, all communication takes place on this path, or circuit. A circuit is dedicated to this call for the duration of the call. The circuit stays active, even if no one is speaking.<br>Although there are many available circuits, it is a finite number. During peak periods, some calls might be denied.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
