<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts packet switching in a data network. Five routers are interconnected within a cloud. A user at a PC is connected to a router on one side of the cloud, and a server is connected to a router on the other side of the cloud. Data packet envelopes are passing between four of the routers, illustrating that there is no specific path through the switches from one computer to the other. Each packet contains a source address, destination address, and a sequence number. <br><br>Many paths can be used for a single communication as individual packets are routed to a destination. No fixed path is established. Packets are routed according to the best path available at the time. Prior to transmission, each communication is broken into packets that are addressed and numbered. During peak periods, communication can be delayed, but is not denied. At the destination, packets are reassembled according to their sequence number. <br>]]></content-text></brief>
