<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts fault tolerance and scalability. <br><br>Fault Tolerance - Local network 1 has three IP phones and three PC's connected to switch 1. Switch 1 is connected to router 1. Router 1 is connected to routers 3 and 4. Routers 3 and 4 are both connected to the Internet. Two arrows point to each redundant route from router 1, with one arrow pointing to router 3 and the other arrow pointing to router 4. If the link from router 1 to router 3 goes down, router 1 can still get to the Internet by going through router 4. <br><br>Local network 2 has three PC's connected to switch 2. Switch 2 is connected to router 2. Router 2 is connected to routers 3 and 4. Routers 3 and 4 are both connected to the Internet. If the link from router 2 to router 3 goes down, router 2 can still get to the Internet by going through router 4. Redundant connections allow for alternate paths if a device or link fails. The user experience is unaffected.<br><br>Scalability - Same image as fault tolerance, but a third local network 1 with three PC's is now connected to a hub. The hub is connected to router 2, showing the expandability or scalability of the network. Additional users and whole networks can be connected to the Internet without degrading performance for existing users.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
