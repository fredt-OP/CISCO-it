<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Video narration text: <br><br>"Welcome, welcome to a brand new day, a new way of getting things done. Welcome to a place where maps are rewritten and remote villages are included. A place where body language is business language. Where people subscribe to people and not magazines, and the team you follow now follows you.<br><br>Welcome to a place where books rewrite themselves. Where you can drag and drop people wherever they want to go, and a phone doubles as a train ticket, plane ticket, or a lift ticket. Welcome to a place where a wedding is captured and recaptured again and again. Where a home video is experienced everywhere at once. Where a library travels across the world. Where businesses are born, countries are transformed, and we are more powerful together than we ever could be apart. Welcome to the human network."<br>]]></content-text></brief>
