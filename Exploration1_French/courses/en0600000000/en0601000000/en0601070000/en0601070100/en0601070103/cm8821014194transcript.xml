<brief><content-text><![CDATA[Link to Packet Tracer Activity: Introduction to Packet Tracer <br><br>Packet Tracer is a standalone simulation and visualization program. PT activities are integrated throughout this course. While formal activities using Packet Tracer begin in the next chapter, if time allows, launch the program now and explore the Help resources, which include "My First PT Lab" and a variety of tutorials to teach you various aspects of the software. Also, ask your instructor how to obtain a copy of PT for your personal use. Every chapter has a Packet Tracer Skills Integration Challenge, which is an activity that allows you to practice most skills that you have learned to that point in the course. PT Skills Integration Challenges allow you to build your practical skills for such things as hands-on performance exams and certification exams.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
