<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts multiple images illustrating the concepts of courseware, collaboration, reference, and administration as components of a network-based online learning environment.<br><br>Courseware - The way we learn is supported by courseware delivered over the data network. Students at remote locations can access the same resources as those available on campus. This course is distributed over the network, and the content is enhanced by links to other resources, which are also on the network. <br><br>Collaboration - Students in different locations can work together on documents and speak together while they work. <br><br>Reference - Updated maintenance instructions are downloaded to a PDA at the time they are needed.<br><br>Administration - In addition to supporting courseware, data networks support administration, enrollment, and teacher-student communication. A text message is sent from an instructor telling students that the next class is in the lab. A student enrolls in classes from home. An administrator publishes the course catalog to a web site.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
