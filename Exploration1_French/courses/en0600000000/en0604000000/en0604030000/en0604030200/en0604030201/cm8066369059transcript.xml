<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts how TCP helps to ensure reliable delivery through data segment acknowledgment. The TCP frame header contains the source and destination ports and sequence and acknowledgement numbers to accomplish this.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>PC1 and PC2 are connected to each other through WAN links to a network cloud. The PC1 speech bubble says: "Start with byte number 1. I am sending 10 bytes. The PC2 speech bubble says: "I received 10 bytes starting with byte number 1. I expect byte number 11 next."<br><br>PC1 sends 10 bytes to PC2 with the following information in the header:<br>Source Port: 1028<br>Destination Port: 23<br>Sequence Number: 1<br>Acknowledgement number: 1<br><br>PC2 sends an acknowledgement of the 10 bytes to PC1, with the following information in the header:<br>Source Port: 23<br>Destination Port: 1028<br>Sequence Number: 1<br>Acknowledgement number: 11<br><br>PC1 sends another 10 bytes to PC2 with the following information in the header:<br>Source Port: 1028<br>Destination Port: 23<br>Sequence Number: 11<br>Acknowledgement number: 1]]></content-text></brief>
