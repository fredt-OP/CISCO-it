<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts how different segments can take different routes through a network and arrive at the destination out of order. When this occurs, they are resequenced by TCP in the original order transmitted at the destination.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>PC1 is connected to one of a group of routers with multiple paths between them. PC2 is connected to one of the other routers on the opposite side of the network. Arrows from PC1 through various routers to PC2 indicate that packets with segments from the same data stream pass through different routers on their way from one PC to the other. TCP compensates by sequencing the segments.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
