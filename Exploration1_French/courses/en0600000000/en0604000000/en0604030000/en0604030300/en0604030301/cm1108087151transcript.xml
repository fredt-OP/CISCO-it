<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts how TCP handles segment loss using retransmission.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>The animation begins with a user at a PC connected to a router at ISP1. The ISP1 router is connected through a network cloud to a router at ISP2. The ISP2 router is connected to a switch, which is connected to a server farm. The server farm contains an FTP server. <br><br>As the animation progresses, TCP packet segments are passed between the user PC and the FTP server at ISP2. The following speech bubbles are displayed:<br>PC1: I am sending this field with FTP using TCP to make sure you receive it!<br>FTP Server: I received the first three. I will send an acknowledgement.<br>PC1: I got an acknowledgment. I will send the next group.<br>FTP Server: I missed the second group. I will send no acknowledgment.<br>PC1: I received no acknowledgement. I will resend the last group.<br>FTP Server: I received the next group. I will send an acknowledgement.<br>The FTP server then sends an acknowledgement back to PC1.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
