<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts how proxy ARP allows a router to respond for a remote host. Two hosts, A and B, are located on Subnet A. Router R1 interface E0 is on Subnet A (172.16.10.0/24). Two other hosts, C and D, are located on Subnet B. Router R1 interface E1 is on Subnet B (172.16.20.0/24).<br><br>Host A has been improperly configured with a /16 subnet mask. This host believes that it is directly connected to all of the 172.16.0.0/16 network, instead of to the 172.16.10.0/24 subnet. The router can act as a proxy ARP and respond to requests for the IPv4 address of hosts on the LAN B network.]]></content-text></brief>
