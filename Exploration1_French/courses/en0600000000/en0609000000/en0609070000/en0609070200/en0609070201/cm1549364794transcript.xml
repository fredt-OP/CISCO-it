<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the ARP process used for mapping IP and MAC addresses to communicate outside the local network. Follow the steps for generating a new pair of addresses in the ARP table when the destination is outside the local network.<br><br>Step 1: Four PC's are shown. PC's A, B, C, and D and a router are attached to common shared media. PC A wants to send a frame to a PC that is outside the local network. It needs to send the frame to the router default gateway. The PC and router have the following IP and MAC addresses:<br><br>PC A IP address: 10.10.0.1, MAC address: 00-0d-88-c7-9a-24<br>Router IP address: 10.10.0.254, MAC address: 00-10-7b-e7-fa-ef<br><br>Step 2: No ARP entry for the gateway. PC A says: I need to send a frame to 172.16.0.10, but it is outside my network, and I don't know the MAC address of my gateway (10.10.0.254).<br><br>Step 3: Broadcast ARP request to devices. PC A says: If your IP address is 10.10.0.254, please tell 10.10.0.2 (00-0d-88-c7-9a-24).<br><br>Step 4: Reply with MAC address of gateway. The router says: I am 10.10.0.254, so I respond with my MAC address 00-10-7b-e7-fa-ef.<br><br>Step 5: IP and MAC addresses are stored in ARP cache. PC A says: I will store 10.10.0.254 and 00-10-7b-e7-fa-ef in my ARP cache.<br><br>Step 6: ARP entry enables frame to be sent. PC A says: I can now send the frame with a packet to 172.16.0.10 with the MAC address 00-10-7b-e7-fa-ef. The router says: I will forward the packet in this frame based on a route in my routing table.]]></content-text></brief>
