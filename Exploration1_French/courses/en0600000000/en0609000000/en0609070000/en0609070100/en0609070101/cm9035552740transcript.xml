<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) process used for mapping IP and MAC addresses for hosts on the local network. Follow the steps for generating a new pair of addresses in the ARP table when the destination is on the local network.<br><br>Step 1: Four PC's are shown. PC's A, B, C, and D and a router are attached to common shared media. PC A wants to send a frame to PC C. These PC's have the following IP and MAC addresses:<br><br>PC A IP address: 10.10.0.1, MAC address: 00-0d-88-c7-9a-24<br>PC C IP address: 10.10.0.3, MAC address: 00-0d-56-09-fb-d1<br><br>Step 2: No ARP entry. PC A says: I need to send a frame to 10.10.0.3, but I don't know the MAC address.<br><br>Step 3: Broadcast ARP request to devices. PC A says: If your IP address is 10.10.0.3, please tell 10.10.0.1 (00-0d-88-c7-9a-24).<br><br>Step 4: Unicast ARP reply with MAC address. PC C says: I am 10.10.0.3. My MAC address is 00-0d-56-09-fb-d1.<br><br>Step 5: IP and MAC addresses for PC D are stored in ARP cache. PC A says: I will store 10.10.0.3 and 00-0d-56-09-fb-d1 in my ARP cache.<br><br>Step 6: ARP entry enables frame to be sent. PC A says: I can now send the frame to 10.10.0.3 with the MAC address 00-0d-56-09-fb-d1.]]></content-text></brief>
