<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts the operation of CSMA/CD in Ethernet. Four PC's, A, B, C, and D are shown connected to shared media using CSMA/CD.<br><br>In the animation, PC C wants to transmit and begins the process through the following steps:<br>1. Carrier Sense - Listen before transmitting, and monitor media for traffic.<br>2. Carrier signal detected.<br>3. Wait for a specified time after signal passes. Try again later.<br>4. Listen before transmitting - Monitoring media for traffic.<br>5. No carrier signal detected - PC C computer transmits.<br><br>PC A and D want to transmit:<br>1. Carrier Sense - both listen before transmitting, and monitor media for traffic.<br>2. No carrier signal detected - PC's A and D transmit at the same time.<br>3. Collision occurs.<br>4. PC's A and D issue a jam signal.<br>5. All PC's set a back-off timer and try again later.]]></content-text></brief>
