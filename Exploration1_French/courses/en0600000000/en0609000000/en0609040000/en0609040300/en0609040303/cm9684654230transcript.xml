<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts Ethernet slot and bit times for various forms of Ethernet. A sending device, Device 1, is connected to the receiving device, Device 2, with four hubs between them. The path from Device 1 to Device 2 and back again to Device 1 is the slot time.<br><br>Ethernet technology speed, slot time, and interval.<br>Speed: 10 Megabits per second<br>Slot Time: 512 bit time<br>Time Interval: 51.2 microseconds<br><br>Speed: 100 Megabits per second<br>Slot Time: 512 bit time<br>Time Interval: 5.12 microseconds<br><br>Speed: 1 Gigabits per second<br>Slot Time: 4096 bit time<br>Time Interval: 4.096 microseconds<br><br>Speed: 10 Gigabits per second<br>Slot Time: not applicable<br>Time Interval: not applicable<br><br>Ethernet technology speed and bit time.<br>Ethernet Speed: 10 Megabits per second<br>Bit time: 100 Nanoseconds<br><br>Ethernet Speed: 100 Megabits per second<br>Bit time: 10 Nanoseconds<br><br>Ethernet Speed: 1000 Megabits per second = 1 Gigabit per second<br>Bit time: 1 Nanosecond<br><br>Ethernet Speed: 10,000 Megabits per second = 10 Gigabits per second<br>Bit time: .1 Nanosecond]]></content-text></brief>
