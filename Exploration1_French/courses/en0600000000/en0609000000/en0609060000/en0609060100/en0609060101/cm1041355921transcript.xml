<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts issues that contribute to the poor performance of hub-based LAN's. Initially six hosts are connected to a hub. As a result, network bandwidth is shared by six hosts. Hub-based LAN performance issues include:<br><br>-	Lack of scalability: Another hub is connected to the first one, with six more hosts attached. The same network bandwidth is now shared by 12 hosts.<br>-	Increased latency: With additional hubs, network latency increases.<br>-	More collisions: With additional hosts, network collisions increase. There is still one collision domain.]]></content-text></brief>
