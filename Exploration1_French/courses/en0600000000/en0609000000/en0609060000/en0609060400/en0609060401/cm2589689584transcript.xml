<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts an activity in which you must determine how the switch forwards a frame based on the source MAC and destination MAC addresses and information in the switch MAC table.<br><br>A 12-port switch is shown with the following connections:<br>-	Host 0A is connected to port FA1.<br>-	Host 0B is connected to port FA3.<br>-	Host 0C is connected to port FA5.<br>-	Host 0D is connected to port FA7.<br>-	Hub1 is connected to port FA9.<br>-	Hosts 0E and 0F are connected to Hub1.<br><br>Additional help:<br>FF is a broadcast MAC address and is forwarded to all ports with the exception of the origin port.<br>A frame is flooded to all ports (except the origin) only if the switch does not have the destination MAC within the MAC table.<br>The switch adds a new MAC address to the MAC table based on the source MAC address. If the source MAC address is already in the table, nothing is added or learned. If the source MAC address is not in the table, the address is added.<br>A switch drops a frame if the destination and source devices are both connected to the same port and the switch has the destination MAC address in the MAC table. In this activity, this occurs on the single port connected to the hub with two host devices.<br><br>Answer the questions using the information provided.<br><br>Note: You may wish to contact your instructor for help with this activity.<br><br>Example 1 scenario and questions.<br>Frame information:<br>-	Destination MAC address: 0D<br>-	Source MAC address: 0B<br><br>MAC table information:<br>Port FA1 MAC address learned is 0A.<br>Port FA5 MAC address learned is 0C.<br>Port FA9 MAC address learned is 0E.<br>No other ports on the switch have learned a MAC address. <br><br>Question 1A. Where will the switch forward the frame? Indicate Yes or No for the ports.<br><br>FA1: Yes or No<br>FA2: Yes or No<br>FA3: Yes or No<br>FA4: Yes or No<br>FA5: Yes or No<br>FA6: Yes or No<br>FA7: Yes or No<br>FA8: Yes or No<br>FA9: Yes or No<br>FA10: Yes or No<br>FA11: Yes or No<br>FA12: Yes or No<br><br>Question 1B. When the switch forwards the frame, which statement or statements are true?<br>A.	Switch adds the source MAC address to the MAC table.<br>B.	Frame is a broadcast frame and will be forwarded to all ports.<br>C.	Frame is a unicast frame and will be sent to specific ports only.<br>D.	Frame is a unicast frame and will be flooded to all ports.<br>E.	Frame is a unicast frame, but it will be dropped at the switch.<br><br>Example 2 scenario and questions.<br>Frame information:<br>-	Destination MAC address: 0F<br>-	Source MAC address: 0B<br><br>MAC table information:<br>Port FA9 MAC address learned is 0E.<br>No other ports on the switch have learned a MAC address. <br><br>Question 2A. Where will the switch forward the frame? Indicate Yes or No for the ports.<br><br>FA1: Yes or No<br>FA2: Yes or N<br>FA3: Yes or No<br>FA4: Yes or No<br>FA5: Yes or No<br>FA6: Yes or No<br>FA7: Yes or No<br>FA8: Yes or No<br>FA9: Yes or No<br>FA10: Yes or No<br>FA11: Yes or No<br>FA12: Yes or No<br><br>Question 2B. When the switch forwards the frame, which statement or statements are true?<br>A.	Switch adds the source MAC address to the MAC table.<br>B.	Frame is a broadcast frame and will be forwarded to all ports.<br>C.	Frame is a unicast frame and will be sent to specific ports only.<br>D.	Frame is a unicast frame and will be flooded to all ports.<br>E.	Frame is a unicast frame, but it will be dropped at the switch.<br><br>Example 3 scenario and questions.<br>Frame information:<br>-	Destination MAC address: 0C<br>-	Source MAC address: 0A<br><br>MAC table information:<br>Port FA1 MAC address learned is 0A.<br>Port FA5 MAC address learned is 0C.<br>Port FA7 MAC address learned is 0D.<br>Port FA9 MAC address learned is 0E.<br>No other ports on the switch have learned a MAC address. <br><br>Question 3A. Where will the switch forward the frame? Indicate Yes or No for the ports.<br><br>FA1: Yes or No<br>FA2: Yes or No<br>FA3: Yes or No<br>FA4: Yes or No<br>FA5: Yes or No<br>FA6: Yes or No<br>FA7: Yes or No<br>FA8: Yes or No<br>FA9: Yes or No<br>FA10: Yes or No<br>FA11: Yes or No<br>FA12: Yes or No<br><br>Question 3B. When the switch forwards the frame, which statement or statements are true?<br>A.	Switch adds the source MAC address to the MAC table.<br>B.	Frame is a broadcast frame and will be forwarded to all ports.<br>C.	Frame is a unicast frame and will be sent to specific ports only.<br>D.	Frame is a unicast frame and will be flooded to all ports.<br>E.	Frame is a unicast frame, but it will be dropped at the switch.]]></content-text></brief>
