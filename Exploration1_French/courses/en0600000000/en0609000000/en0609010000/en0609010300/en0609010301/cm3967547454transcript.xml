<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the functions of the LLC sublayer as an interface to the 8 0 2 dot 3 MAC sublayer.<br><br>LLC functions include:<br>-	Making the connection with the upper layers.<br>-	Framing the Network Layer packet.<br>-	Identifying the Network Layer protocol.<br>-	Remaining relatively independent of the physical equipment.<br><br>A hierarchical model of sublayers shows the following layers from top to bottom: the LLC sublayer, the 8 0 2 dot 3 MAC sublayer, the physical signaling sublayer, and the physical medium itself. Various Ethernet physical technologies are listed within the physical signaling sublayer and the physical medium, which include:<br><br>-	10BASE5 (500m) 50 Ohm Coax N-Style<br>-	10BASE2 (185m) 50 Ohm Coax BNC<br>-	10BASE-T (100m) 100 Ohm UTP RJ-45<br>-	100BASE-TX (100m) 100 Ohm UTP RJ-45<br>-	1000BASE-CX (25m) 150 Ohm STP mini-DB-9<br>-	1000BASE-T (100m) 100 Ohm UTP RJ-45<br>-	1000BASE-ST (220-550m) multimode fiber SC<br>-	1000BASE-LX (550-5000m) multimode or single-mode fiber SC]]></content-text></brief>
