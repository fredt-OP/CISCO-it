<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts how static routes can be used to allow routers to forward packets. <br><br>Network Topology:<br>The router A interface with IP address 192.168.2.1/24 is connected to an interface on router B with IP address 192.168.2.2/24. The router B interface with IP address 192.168.1.1/24 is connected to an interface on router C with IP address 192.168.1.2/24. Router C also has two local networks connected on two of its other interfaces: network 10.1.1.0/24 and network 10.1.2.0/24. Routers A and B are configured with routes. <br><br>Router A Configuration:<br>Router A IP address 192.168.2.2/24 is configured manually as the next hop for networks 10.1.1.0/24 and 10.1.2.0/24 on router C.<br><br>Router B Configuration:<br>Router B IP address 192.168.1.2/24 is configured manually as the next hop for networks 10.1.1.0/24 and 10.1.2.0/24 on router C.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
