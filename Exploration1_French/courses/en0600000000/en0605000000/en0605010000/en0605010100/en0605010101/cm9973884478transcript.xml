<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The animation depicts one host communicating with another through the layers of the O S I model. Host A sends data down the O S I model layers on one side through a group of interconnected routers and then up the O S I model layers on the other side to Host B. The animation concentrates on the Network Layer protocols and how they forward encapsulated Transport Layer PDU's between hosts. As the animation progresses, the following occurs:<br><br>Step 1. Host A sends data from its source address 192.168.32.11 to Host B destination address 192.168.36.5.<br>Step 2. Host A data is encapsulated at the Transport Layer into a segment.<br>Step 3. The Host A segment is encapsulated at the Network Layer into a packet.<br>Step 4. The Host A packet is encapsulated at the Data Link Layer into a frame.<br>Step 5. The Host A frame is transmitted on the media as bits at the Physical Layer.<br>Step 6. The Host A bits (ones and zeroes) travel through a group of routers in a cloud to the Physical Layer of Host B.<br>Step 7. At Host B, the bits are received on the media at the Physical Layer and sent to the Data Link Layer.<br>Step 8. The Host B frame is decapsulated at the Data Link Layer into a packet.<br>Step 9. The Host B packet is decapsulated at the Network Layer into a segment.<br>Step 10. The Host B segment is decapsulated at the Transport Layer into data and sent to the destination application.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
