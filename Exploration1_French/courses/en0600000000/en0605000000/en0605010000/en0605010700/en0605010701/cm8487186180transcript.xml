<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the IPv4 packet header fields. Information is provided for selected fields. <br><br>Ver.<br>IHL<br>Type of Service - Data Q o S priority. Enables the router to give priority to voice and network route information over regular data.<br>Packet Length<br>Identification<br>Flag - These 3 bits represent control flags, such as DF and MF.<br>Fragment Offset - These 13 bits allow a receiver to determine the place of a particular fragment in the original IP datagram.<br>Time to Live - Number of hops before the packet is dropped. This value is decremented at each hop to prevent packets being passed around the network in routing loops.<br>Protocol - Data payload protocol type. Indicates whether the data is a UDP datagram or TCP segment because these Transport Layer protocols manage the receipt of their PDU's differently.<br>Header Checksum<br>Source Address - IPv4 address of the host sending the packet. Remains unchanged throughout the passage of the packet across the internetwork. Enables the destination host to respond to the source if required.<br>Destination Address - IPv4 address of the host to receive the packet. Remains unchanged throughout the passage of the packet across the internetwork. Enables routers at each hop to forward the packet toward the destination.<br>Options<br>Padding]]></content-text></brief>
