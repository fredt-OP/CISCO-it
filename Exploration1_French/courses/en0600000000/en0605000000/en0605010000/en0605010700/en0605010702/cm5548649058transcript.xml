<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts the IPv4 packet header fields in the same sequence as Diagram 1. Information is provided for selected fields other than those in the previous diagram. <br><br>Ver. - IP version number.<br>IHL - Size of the packet header. This is necessary because the Options field means that the header size can vary, and the protocol needs to know where the header ends and the data starts when processing the packet.<br>Type of Service<br>Packet Length - Size of entire packet, including the header and data, in bytes. The packet must be a minimum of 20 bytes (20 bytes header + 0 bytes data) and a maximum of 65,535.<br>Identification - Uniquely identifies fragments of an original IP packet.<br>Flag<br>Fragment Offset<br>Time to Live<br>Protocol<br>Header Checksum - For error checking the packet header. At each hop, the header checksum must be compared to the value of this field. If the header checksum does not match the calculated checksum, the packet is discarded. At each hop, the TTL field is decremented. Fragmentation is also possible, so the checksum has to be recalculated at each hop. This checksum only applies to the header, not the encapsulated data. <br>Source Address<br>Destination Address<br>Options - Additional fields to provide other services; rarely used.<br>Padding]]></content-text></brief>
