<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts how gateways enable communication between networks.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>Hosts PC1 and PC2 are connected to switch S1 in LAN1. Switch S1 is connected to gateway router R1. Hosts PC3 and PC4 are connected to switch S2 in LAN2. Switch S2 is connected to gateway router R2. Gateway router R1 at the edge of LAN1 is connected to gateway router R2 at the edge of LAN2.<br><br>LAN1 IP Addressing:<br>PC1 IP address: 192.168.2.30/24<br>PC2 IP address: 192.168.2.31/24<br>Gateway Router R1: 192.168.2.1/24<br><br>LAN2 IP Addressing:<br>PC3 IP address: 192.168.3.4/24<br>PC4 IP address: 192.168.3.5/24<br>Gateway Router R1: 192.168.3.1/24<br><br>A speech bubble for PC1 in LAN1 states: I only know the addresses of the devices in my network. If I don't know that address of the destination device, I send the packet to the gateway address by default.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
