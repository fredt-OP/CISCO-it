<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts how a router moves a packet toward its destination when there is no route entry for the destination network, but a default route exists. An IP packet with data inside moves toward the router. It is labeled Data for network 172.16.2.0. A Data Link Layer 2 header and trailer encapsulate the packet. The following are the main steps in the process. <br>1.	The router removes the Layer 2 encapsulation.<br>2.	The router extracts the destination IP address.<br>3.	The router checks the routing table for a match.<br>4.	Network 172.16.2.0 is not in the routing table, but a default route to 192.168.1.2 exists.<br>5.	The router re-encapsulates the packet.<br>6.	The packet is sent to interface 192.168.1.2.]]></content-text></brief>
