<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts separating a network to provide increased security and control access from the Internet. Firewalls control access to the Administrator and Researcher segments of the network.<br><br>Network Topology:<br>On the Administrator and Student records segment, hosts PC1, PC2, PC3, Server1, and Server2 are connected to switch S1. Switch S1 is connected to router R1. Router R1 is connected to a firewall, which is connected to the Internet.<br><br>On the Researcher segment, hosts PC4, PC5, PC6, Server3, and Server4 are connected to switch S2. Switch S2 is connected to router R2. Router R2 is connected to a firewall, which is connected to the Internet.<br><br>Access Granted: Each user can reach servers in its own department. Administrators are allowed access to Student records servers in the Administrator segment of the network. Researchers are allowed access to Research servers in the Research segment of the network.<br><br>Access Denied: The firewalls control access between departments. Each user is blocked from reaching servers in other departments. A user from the Administrator segment of the network who attempts to access the Research segment is rejected at the firewall.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
