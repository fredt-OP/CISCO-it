The simple fact of wiring together the physical network can make geographic location a logical place to start when segmenting a network.<br><br>Purpose: The volume and type of data generated by a class of users may make it appropriate to group similar users into a network. The large network is divided into two smaller ones based on purpose or departmental function:<br>Art Department - Contains video development workstations and servers. A speech bubble above the workstations states: Artists need high bandwidth to create video.<br>Sales Office - Contains a laptop connected to a server. A speech bubble above the laptop states: Salespeople need 100% reliability and speed.<br><br>Ownership: Grouping hosts into networks based on ownership can enhance data security. The network is divided into two segments: corporate records and public web site. An external user is attempting to access files in both locations. A firewall at the corporate records location has an X on it, and the text states: STOP! No entry to the public. A speech bubble above the servers states: We own these servers.<br>A firewall at the public web site location has text that states: Enter with permission. A speech bubble above the servers states: We own these servers.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
