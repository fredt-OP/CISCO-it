<brief><content-text><![CDATA[The diagram depicts separating a network using a router to limit broadcasts and improve performance. <br><br>Network Topology 1:<br>Hosts PC1, PC2, PC3, and Server1 are connected to switch S1. Hosts PC4, PC5, PC6, and Server2 are connected to switch S2. Switches S1 and S2 are connected to switch S3. <br><br>All devices in this network are connected in one broadcast domain when the switch is set to the factory default settings. Because switches forward broadcasts by default, broadcasts are processed by all devices in this network.<br><br>Network Topology 2:<br>Hosts PC1, PC2, PC3, and Server1 are connected to switch S1. Hosts PC4, PC5, PC6, and Server2 are connected to switch S2. Switches S1 and S2 are connected to router R1, which replaces switch S3. <br><br>Replacing the middle switch with a router creates two IP subnets, creating two distinct broadcast domains. All devices are connected, but local broadcasts are contained.<br>]]></content-text></brief>
