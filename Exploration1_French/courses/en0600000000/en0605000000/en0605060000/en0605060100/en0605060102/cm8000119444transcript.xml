<brief><content-text><![CDATA[<br>This is a review and is not a quiz. Questions and answers are provided. <br>Question 1. What does the Network Layer do to a Transport Layer PDU so that it can be communicated from one host to another?<br>Answer: The Network Layer protocol encapsulates, or packages, the Transport Layer segment or datagram so that the network can deliver it to the destination host. The IPv4 encapsulation remains in place from the time the packet leaves the Network Layer of the originating host until it arrives at the Network Layer of the destination host. The routing performed by intermediary devices only considers the contents of the packet header that encapsulates the segment. In all cases, the data portion of the packet - that is, the encapsulated Transport Layer PDU - remains unchanged during the Network Layer processes.<br><br>Question 2. State the purpose of the Time-to-Live field in the IPv4 packet header.<br>Answer: The Time-to-Live (TTL) field is an 8-bit binary value that indicates the remaining life of the packet. The TTL value is decreased by at least one each time the packet is processed by a router (that is, each hop). When the value becomes zero, the router discards or drops the packet, and it is removed from the network data flow. This mechanism prevents packets that cannot reach their destination from being forwarded indefinitely between routers in a routing loop. If routing loops were permitted to continue, the network would become congested with data packets that will never reach their destination. Decrementing the TTL value at each hop ensures that it eventually becomes zero and that the packet with the expired TTL field is dropped.<br><br>Question 3. List three reasons for dividing a network into smaller groups of hosts.<br>Answer: <br>-	Geographic location<br>-	Purpose<br>-	Ownership<br><br>Question 4. What are three basic characteristics of IPv4?<br>Answer: IPv4 basic characteristics:<br>-	Connectionless - No connection is established before sending data packets.<br>-	Best Effort (unreliable) - No overhead is used to guarantee packet delivery.<br>-	Media Independent - Operates independently of the medium carrying the data.<br><br>Question 5. Describe the packet header field used by the router to determine where to forward a packet.<br>Answer: The IPv4 Destination Address field contains the Layer 3 address of the destination host. The router uses the network portion of this address to determine where to forward the packet.<br><br>Question 6. What is the purpose of configuring a host with the address of the default gateway?<br>Answer: The gateway, also known as the default gateway, is needed to send a packet out of the local network. If the network portion of the destination address of the packet is different from the network of the originating host, the packet has to be routed outside the original network. To do this, the packet is sent to the gateway. This gateway is a router interface connected to the local network. The gateway interface has a Network Layer address that matches the network address of the hosts. The hosts are configured to recognize that address as the gateway.<br><br>Question 7. What two types of networks are shown in the routing table?<br>Answer: <br>- Directly connected networks<br>- Remote networks<br><br>The routing table stores information about connected and remote networks. Connected networks are directly attached to one of the router interfaces. These interfaces are the gateways for the hosts on different local networks. Remote networks are networks that are not directly connected to the router. Routes to these networks can be manually configured on the router by the network administrator or learned automatically using dynamic routing protocols.<br><br>Question 8. Describe the three features of a route listed in a routing table.<br>Answer: Routes in a routing table have three main features:<br>-	Destination network<br>-	Next-hop<br>-	Metric<br><br>The router matches the destination address in the packet header with the destination network of a route in the routing table and forwards the packet to the next-hop router specified by that route. If there are two or more possible routes to the same destination, the metric is used to decide the next hop.<br><br>Question 9. If the destination network for a packet is not in the router's routing table, what are the two possible outcomes?<br>Answer: The packet is dropped, or it might be forwarded to the default route if one is configured.<br><br>Question 10. List the three possible actions a router can perform to a packet.<br>Answer: Packet forwarding or routing is done packet-by-packet and hop-by-hop. Each packet is treated independently in each router along the path. At each hop, the router examines the destination IP address for each packet and then checks the routing table for forwarding information.<br><br>The router does one of three things with the packet:<br>-	Forwards it to the next-hop router.<br>-	Forwards it to the destination host.<br>-	Drops it.]]></content-text></brief>
